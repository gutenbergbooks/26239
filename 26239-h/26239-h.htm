<p style=' font-size:1.2em;'>AUTHOR&#8217;S FOREWORD</p>
</div>

<p>This little story is the outcome of two trips
(neither of which was in the Bear Tooth
Forest) during the years 1909 and 1910. Its
main claim on the reader&#8217;s interest will lie, no
doubt, in the character of Berea McFarlane;
but I find myself re-living with keen pleasure
the splendid drama of wind and cloud and
swaying forest which made the expeditions
memorable.</p>
<p>The golden trail is an actuality for me. The
camp on the lake was mine. The rain, the snow
I met. The prying camp-robbers, the grouse,
the muskrats, the beaver were my companions.
But Berrie was with me only in imagination.
She is a fiction, born of a momentary, powerful
hand-clasp of a Western rancher&#8217;s daughter.
The story of Wayland Norcross is fiction also.
But the McFarlane ranch, the mill, and the
lonely ranger-stations are closely drawn pictures
of realities. Although the stage of my comedy
is Colorado, I have not held to any one locality.
The scene is composite.</p>
<p>It was my intention, originally, to write a much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
longer and more important book concerning
Supervisor McFarlane, but Berrie took the story
into her own strong hands and made of it something
so intimate and so idyllic that I could not
bring the more prosaic element into it. It remained
personal and youthful in spite of my
plans, a divergence for which, perhaps, most of
my readers will be grateful.</p>
<p>As for its title, I had little to do with its
selection. My daughter, Mary Isabel, aged ten,
selected it from among a half-dozen others,
and for luck I let it stand, although it sounds
somewhat like that of a paper-bound German
romance. For the sub-title my publishers are
responsible.</p>
<p>Finally, I warn the reader that this is merely
the very slender story of a young Western girl
who, being desired of three strong men, bestows
her love on a &#8220;tourist&#8221; whose weakness is at
once her allurement and her care. The administration
problem, the sociologic theme, which was
to have made the novel worth while, got lost in
some way on the low trail and never caught up
with the lovers. I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;but so it was!</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<h3>THE HAPPY GIRL</h3>
</div>

<p>The stage line which ran from Williams to
Bear Tooth (one of the most authentic then
to be found in all the West) possessed at least one
genuine Concord coach, so faded, so saddened,
so cracked, and so splintered that its passengers
entered it under protest, and alighted from it
with thanksgiving, and yet it must have been
built by honorable men, for in 190- it still made
the run of one hundred and twenty miles twice
each week without loss of wheel or even so much
as moulting a scrap of paint.</p>
<p>And yet, whatever it may have been in its
youth, it was in its age no longer a gay dash of
color in the landscape. On the contrary, it
fitted into the dust-brown and sage-green plain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
as defensively as a beetle in a dusty path. Nevertheless,
it was an indispensable part of a very
moving picture as it crept, creaking and groaning
(or it may be it was the suffering passenger
creaking and groaning), along the hillside.</p>
<p>After leaving the Grande River the road winds
up a pretty high divide before plunging down into
Ute Park, as they call all that region lying between
the Continental Range on the east and
the Bear Tooth plateau on the west. It was a
big spread of land, and very far from an Eastern
man&#8217;s conception of a park. From Dome Peak
it seems a plain; but, in fact, when clouds shut
off the high summits to the west, this &#8220;valley&#8221;
becomes a veritable mountain land, a tumbled,
lonely country, over which an occasional horseman
crawls, a minute but persistent insect. It
is, to be exact, a succession of ridges and ravines,
sculptured (in some far-off, post-glacial time) by
floods of water, covered now, rather sparsely,
with pinons, cedars, and aspens, a dry, forbidding,
but majestic landscape.</p>
<p>In late August the hills become iridescent,
opaline with the translucent yellow of the aspen,
the coral and crimson of the fire-weed, the blood-red
of huckleberry beds, and the royal purple of
the asters, while flowing round all, as solvent and
neutral setting, lies the gray-green of the ever-present
and ever-enduring sage-brush. On the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
loftier heights these colors are arranged in most
intricate and cunning patterns, with nothing
hard, nothing flaring in the prospect. All is
harmonious and restful. It is, moreover, silent,
silent as a dream world, and so flooded with light
that the senses ache with the stress of it.</p>
<p>Through this gorgeous land of mist, of stillness,
and of death, a few years ago a pale young
man (seated beside the driver) rode one summer
day in a voiceless rapture which made Bill McCoy
weary.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d had as much of this as I have you&#8217;d
talk of something else,&#8221; he growled, after a half
dozen attempts at conversation. Bill wasn&#8217;t
much to look at, but he was a good driver and
the stranger respected him for it.</p>
<p>Eventually this simple-minded horseman became
curious about the slim young fellow sitting
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doing out here, anyhow&mdash;fishing
or just rebuilding a lung?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rebuilding two lungs,&#8221; answered the tourist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this climate will just about put lungs
into a coffee-can,&#8221; retorted Bill, with official
loyalty to his country.</p>
<p>To his discerning eye &#8220;the tourist&#8221; now became
&#8220;a lunger.&#8221; &#8220;Where do you live when
you&#8217;re to home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Connecticut.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know it?&#8221; The youth seemed
really interested to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I drove another fellow up here last fall that
dealt out the same kind of brogue you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>This amused the tourist. &#8220;You think I have
a &#8216;brogue,&#8217; do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&mdash;I know it!&#8221; Bill replied,
shortly.</p>
<p>He was prevented at the moment from pursuing
this line of inquiry by the discovery of a
couple of horsemen racing from a distant ranch
toward the road. It was plain, even to the
stranger, that they intended to intercept the
stage, and Bill plied the lash with sudden vigor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give &#8217;em a chase,&#8221; said he, grimly.</p>
<p>The other appeared a little alarmed, &#8220;What
are they&mdash;bandits?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bandits!&#8221; sneered Bill. &#8220;Your eyesight is
piercing. Them&#8217;s <i>girls</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traveler apologized. &#8220;My eyes aren&#8217;t very
good,&#8221; he said, hurriedly.</p>
<p>He was, however, quite justified in his mistake,
for both riders wore wide-rimmed sombreros
and rode astride at a furious pace, bandanas
fluttering, skirts streaming, and one was calling
in shrill command, &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Oh, Bill</span>!&#8221;</p>
<p>As they neared the gate the driver drew up
with a word of surprise. &#8220;Why, howdy, girls,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
howdy!&#8221; he said, with an assumption of innocence.
&#8220;Were you wishin&#8217; fer to speak to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up!&#8221; commanded one of the girls,
a round-faced, freckled romp. &#8220;You know perfectly
well that Berrie is going home to-day&mdash;we
told you all about it yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; exclaimed Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgot all
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like nothin&#8217;!&#8221; exclaimed the maid. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been countin&#8217; the hours till you got here&mdash;I
know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile her companion had slipped from
her horse. &#8220;Well, good-by, Molly, wish I could
stay longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by. Run down again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. You come up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young passenger sprang to the ground and
politely said: &#8220;May I help you in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill stared, the girl smiled, and her companion
called: &#8220;Be careful, Berrie, don&#8217;t hurt yourself,
the wagon might pitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth, perceiving that he had made another
mistake, stammered an apology.</p>
<p>The girl perceived his embarrassment and
sweetly accepted his hand. &#8220;I am much obliged,
all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill shook with malicious laughter. &#8220;Out in
this country girls are warranted to jump clean
over a measly little hack like this,&#8221; he explained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>The girl took a seat in the back corner of the
dusty vehicle, and Bill opened conversation with
her by asking what kind of a time she had been
having &#8220;in the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did ye get as far back as my old town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What town is that, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come off! You know I&#8217;m from Omaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I only got as far as South Bend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The picture which the girl had made as she
dashed up to the pasture gate (her hat-rim blown
away from her brown face and sparkling eyes),
united with the kindliness in her voice as she
accepted his gallant aid, entered a deep impression
on the tourist&#8217;s mind; but he did not
turn his head to look at her&mdash;perhaps he feared
Bill&#8217;s elbow quite as much as his guffaw&mdash;but
he listened closely, and by listening learned that
she had been &#8220;East&#8221; for several weeks, and also
that she was known, and favorably known, all
along the line, for whenever they met a team or
passed a ranch some one called out, &#8220;Hello,
Berrie!&#8221; in cordial salute, and the men, old and
young, were especially pleased to see her.</p>

THE GIRL BEHIND HIM WAS A WONDROUS PART OF THIS WILD AND UNACCOUNTABLE COUNTRY<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the stage rose and fell over the
gigantic swells like a tiny boat on a monster sea,
while the sun blazed ever more fervently from
the splendid sky, and the hills glowed with ever-increasing
tumult of color. Through this land of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
color, of repose, of romance, the young traveler
rode, drinking deep of the germless air, feeling
that the girl behind him was a wondrous part of
this wild and unaccountable country.</p>
<p>He had no chance to study her face again till
the coach rolled down the hill to &#8220;Yancy&#8217;s,&#8221;
where they were to take dinner and change
horses.</p>
<p>Yancy&#8217;s ranch-house stood on the bank of a
fine stream which purled&mdash;in keen defiance of
the hot sun&mdash;over a gravel bed, so near to the
mountain snows that their coolness still lingered
in the ripples. The house, a long, low, log hut,
was fenced with antlers of the elk, adorned with
morning-glory vines, and shaded by lofty cottonwood-trees,
and its green grass-plat&mdash;after the
sun-smit hills of the long morning&#8217;s ride&mdash;was
very grateful to the Eastern man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>With intent to show Bill that he did not greatly
fear his smiles, the youth sprang down and
offered a hand to assist his charming fellow-passenger
to alight; and she, with kindly understanding,
again accepted his aid&mdash;to Bill&#8217;s chagrin&mdash;and
they walked up the path side by side.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all very new and wonderful to me,&#8221;
the young man said in explanation; &#8220;but I suppose
it&#8217;s quite commonplace to you&mdash;and Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no&mdash;it&#8217;s home!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were born here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I was born in the East; but I&#8217;ve lived
here ever since I was three years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By East you mean Kansas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Missouri,&#8221; she laughed back at him.</p>
<p>She was taller than most women, and gave
out an air of fine unconscious health which made
her good to see, although her face was too broad
to be pretty. She smiled easily, and her teeth
were white and even. Her hand he noticed was
as strong as steel and brown as leather. Her
neck rose from her shoulders like that of an acrobat,
and she walked with the sense of security
which comes from self-reliant strength.</p>
<p>She was met at the door by old lady Yancy,
who pumped her hand up and down, exclaiming:
&#8220;My stars, I&#8217;m glad to see ye back! &#8217;Pears like
the country is just naturally goin&#8217; to the dogs
without you. The dance last Saturday was a
frost, so I hear, no snap to the fiddlin&#8217;, no gimp
to the jiggin&#8217;. It shorely was pitiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yancy himself, tall, grizzled, succinct, shook
her hand in his turn. &#8220;Ma&#8217;s right, girl, the
country needs ye. I&#8217;m scared every time ye
go away fer fear some feller will snap ye up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed. &#8220;No danger. Well, how are
ye all, anyway?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;All well, &#8216;ceptin&#8217; me,&#8221; said the little old
woman. &#8220;I&#8217;m just about able to pick at my
vittles.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She does her share o&#8217; the work, and half the
cook&#8217;s besides,&#8221; volunteered Yancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know her,&#8221; retorted Berrie, as she laid off
her hat. &#8220;It&#8217;s me for a dip. Gee, but it&#8217;s dusty
on the road!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young tourist&mdash;he signed W. W. Norcross
in Yancy&#8217;s register&mdash;watched her closely and
listened to every word she spoke with an intensity
of interest which led Mrs. Yancy to
say, privately:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears like that young &#8216;lunger&#8217; ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
forgit you if he can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think he&#8217;s a &#8216;lunger&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t haf to think. One look at him is
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereafter a softer light&mdash;the light of pity&mdash;shone
in the eyes of the girl. &#8220;Poor fellow, he
does look kind o&#8217; peaked; but this climate will
bring him up to the scratch,&#8221; she added, with
optimistic faith in her beloved hills.</p>
<p>A moment later the down-coming stage pulled
in, loaded to the side-lines, and everybody on
it seemed to know Berea McFarlane. It was
hello here and hello there, and how are ye between,
with smacks from the women and open
cries of &#8220;pass it around&#8221; on the part of the men,
till Norcross marveled at the display.</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems a great favorite,&#8221; he observed to
Yancy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;Berrie? She&#8217;s the whole works up
at Bear Tooth. Good thing she don&#8217;t want to
go to Congress&mdash;she&#8217;d lay Jim Worthy on the
shelf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berea&#8217;s popularity was not so remarkable as
her manner of receiving it. She took it all as
a sort of joke&mdash;a good, kindly joke. She shook
hands with her male admirers, and smacked the
cheeks of her female friends with an air of
modest deprecation. &#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t mean it,&#8221;
was one of her phrases. She enjoyed this display
of affection, but it seemed not to touch her
deeply, and her impartial, humorous acceptance
of the courtship of the men was equally charming,
though this was due, according to remark,
to the claims of some rancher up the line.</p>
<p>She continued to be the theme of conversation
at the dinner-table and yet remained unembarrassed,
and gave back quite as good as she
received.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was Cliff,&#8221; declared one lanky admirer,
&#8220;I&#8217;d be shot if I let you out of my sight. It
ain&#8217;t safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled broadly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>you&#8217;re</i> all right! It&#8217;s the other feller&mdash;like
me&mdash;that gets hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re old enough and tough
enough to turn a steel-jacketed bullet.&#8221;</p>
<p>This raised a laugh, and Mrs. Yancy, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
waiting on the table, put in a word: &#8220;I&#8217;ll board
ye free, Berrie, if you&#8217;ll jest naturally turn up
here regular at meal-time. You do take the fellers&#8217;
appetites. It&#8217;s the only time I make a
cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the Eastern man this was all very unrestrained
and deeply diverting. The people
seemed to know all about one another notwithstanding
the fact that they came from ranches
scattered up and down the stage line twenty,
thirty miles apart&mdash;to be neighbors in this
country means to be anywhere within a sixty-mile
ride&mdash;and they gossiped of the countryside
as minutely as the residents of a village in Wisconsin
discuss their kind. News was scarce.</p>
<p>The north-bound coach got away first, and
as the girl came out to take her place, Norcross
said: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you have my seat with the driver?&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped her voice humorously. &#8220;No,
thank you, I can&#8217;t stand for Bill&#8217;s clack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross understood. She didn&#8217;t relish the
notion of being so close to the frankly amorous
driver, who neglected no opportunity to be personal;
therefore, he helped her to her seat inside
and resumed his place in front.</p>
<p>Bill, now broadly communicative, minutely
detailed his tastes in food, horses, liquors, and
saddles in a long monologue which would have
been tiresome to any one but an imaginative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
young Eastern student. Bill had a vast knowledge
of the West, but a distressing habit of
repetition. He was self-conscious, too, for the
reason that he was really talking for the benefit
of the girl sitting in critical silence behind him,
who, though he frequently turned to her for
confirmation of some of the more startling of
his statements, refused to be drawn into controversy.</p>
<p>In this informing way some ten miles were
traversed, the road climbing ever higher, and
the mountains to right and left increasing in
grandeur each hour, till of a sudden and in a deep
valley on the bank of another swift stream, they
came upon a squalid saloon and a minute post-office.
This was the town of Moskow.</p>
<p>Bill, lumbering down over the wheel, took a
bag of mail from the boot and dragged it into
the cabin. The girl rose, stretched herself, and
said: &#8220;This stagin&#8217; is slow business. I&#8217;m
cramped. I&#8217;m going to walk on ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I go with you?&#8221; asked Norcross.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing! Come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they crossed the little pole bridge which
spanned the flood, the tourist exclaimed: &#8220;What
exquisite water! It&#8217;s like melted opals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Comes right down from the snow,&#8221; she answered,
impressed by the poetry of his simile.</p>
<p>He would gladly have lingered, listening to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
song of the water, but as she passed on, he
followed. The opposite hill was sharp and the
road stony, but as they reached the top the
young Easterner called out, &#8220;See the savins!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before them stood a grove of cedars, old, gray,
and drear, as weirdly impressive as the cacti in a
Mexican desert. Torn by winds, scarred by lightnings,
deeply rooted, tenacious as tradition, unlovely
as Egyptian mummies, fantastic, dwarfed
and blackened, these unaccountable creatures
clung to the ledges. The dead mingled horribly
with the living, and when the wind arose&mdash;the
wind that was robustly cheerful on the high hills&mdash;these
hags cried out with low moans of infinite
despair. It was as if they pleaded for water or
for deliverance from a life that was a kind of
death.</p>
<p>The pale young man shuddered. &#8220;What a
ghostly place!&#8221; he exclaimed, in a low voice.
&#8220;It seems the burial-place of a vanished race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in his face, some note in his voice
profoundly moved the girl. For the first time
her face showed something other than childish
good nature and a sense of humor. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like these trees myself,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;They
look too much like poor old squaws.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments the man and the maid
studied the forest of immemorial, gaunt, and
withered trees&mdash;bright, impermanent youth confronting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
time-defaced and wind-torn age. Then
the girl spoke: &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of here. I shall
cry if we don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few moments the dolorous voices were left
behind, and the cheerful light of the plain reasserted
itself. Norcross, looking back down
upon the cedars, which at a distance resembled
a tufted, bronze-green carpet, musingly asked:
&#8220;What do you suppose planted those trees
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was deeply impressed by the novelty
of this query. &#8220;I never thought to ask. I
reckon they just grew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s a reason for all these plantings,&#8221;
he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t worry ourselves much about such
things out here,&#8221; she replied, with charming
humor. &#8220;We don&#8217;t even worry about the
weather. We just take things as they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked on talking with new intimacy.
&#8220;Where is your home?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few miles out of Bear Tooth. You&#8217;re from
the East, Bill says&mdash;&#8216;the far East,&#8217; we call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From New Haven. I&#8217;ve just finished at Yale.
Have you ever been to New York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good Lord, no!&#8221; she answered, as though
he had named the ends of the earth. &#8220;My
mother came from the South&mdash;she was born in
Kentucky&mdash;that accounts for my name, and my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
father is a Missourian. Let&#8217;s see, Yale is in the
state of Connecticut, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Connecticut is no longer a state; it is only a
suburb of New York City.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? My geography calls it &#8216;The
Nutmeg State.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your geography is behind the times. New
York has absorbed all of Connecticut and part of
Jersey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all the same to us out here. Your
whole country looks like the small end of a slice
of pie to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been in a city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I go to Denver once in a while, and
I saw St. Louis once; but I was only a yearling,
and don&#8217;t remember much about it. What are
you doing out here, if it&#8217;s a fair question?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked away at the mountains. &#8220;I got
rather used up last spring, and my doctor said
I&#8217;d better come out here for a while and build
up. I&#8217;m going up to Meeker&#8217;s Mill. Do you
know where that is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know every stove-pipe in this park,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Joe Meeker is kind o&#8217; related to
me&mdash;uncle by marriage. He lives about fifteen
miles over the hill from Bear Tooth.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fact seemed to bring them still closer
together. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; he said, pointedly.
&#8220;Perhaps I shall be permitted to see you now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
again? I&#8217;m going to be lonesome for a while,
I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it! Joe Meeker&#8217;s boys will
keep you interested,&#8221; she assured him.</p>
<p>The stage overtook them at this point, and
Bill surlily remarked: &#8220;If you&#8217;d been alone,
young feller, I&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; give you a chase.&#8221; His resentment
of the outsider&#8217;s growing favor with the
girl was ludicrously evident.</p>
<p>As they rose into the higher levels the aspen
shook its yellowish leaves in the breeze, and the
purple foot-hills gained in majesty. Great new
peaks came into view on the right, and the
lofty cliffs of the Bear Tooth range loomed in
naked grandeur high above the blue-green of
the pines which clothed their sloping eastern
sides.</p>
<p>At intervals the road passed small log ranches
crouching low on the banks of creeks; but aside
from these&mdash;and the sparse animal life around
them&mdash;no sign of settlement could be seen. The
valley lay as it had lain for thousands of years,
repeating its forests as the meadows of the lower
levels send forth their annual grasses. Norcross
said to himself: &#8220;I have circled the track of
progress and have re-entered the border America,
where the stage-coach is still the one stirring
thing beneath the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last the driver, with a note of exultation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
called out: &#8220;Grab a root, everybody, it&#8217;s all the
way down-hill and time to feed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, as the dusk came over the mighty
spread of the hills to the east, and the peaks to
the west darkened from violet to purple-black,
the stage rumbled and rattled and rushed down
the winding road through thickening signs of
civilization, and just at nightfall rolled into the
little town of Bear Tooth, which is the eastern
gateway of the Ute Plateau.</p>
<p>Norcross had given a great deal of thought to
the young girl behind him, and thought had
deepened her charm. Her frankness, her humor,
her superb physical strength and her calm self-reliance
appealed to him, and the more dangerously,
because he was so well aware of his own
weakness and loneliness, and as the stage drew
up before the hotel, he fervently said: &#8220;I hope I
shall see you again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she could reply a man&#8217;s voice called:
&#8220;Hello, there!&#8221; and a tall fellow stepped up to
her with confident mien.</p>
<p>Norcross awkwardly shrank away. This was
her cowboy lover, of course. It was impossible
that so attractive a girl should be unattached,
and the knowledge produced in him a faint but
very definite pang of envy and regret.</p>
<p>The happy girl, even in the excitement of
meeting her lover, did not forget the stranger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
She gave him her hand in parting, and again he
thrilled to its amazing power. It was small,
but it was like a steel clamp. &#8220;Stop in on your
way to Meeker&#8217;s,&#8221; she said, as a kindly man
would have done. &#8220;You pass our gate. My
father is Joseph McFarlane, the Forest Supervisor.
Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; he returned, with sincere
liking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; Norcross heard her companion
ask.</p>
<p>She replied in a low voice, but he overheard
her answer, &#8220;A poor &#8216;lunger,&#8217; bound for
Meeker&#8217;s&mdash;and Kingdom Come, I&#8217;m afraid.
He seems a nice young feller, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They always wait till the last minute,&#8221; remarked
the rancher, with indifferent tone.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>A RIDE IN THE RAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>There are two Colorados within the boundaries
of the state of that name, distinct, almost
irreconcilable. One is a plain (smooth, dry,
monotonous), gently declining to the east, a
land of sage-brush, wheat-fields, and alfalfa
meadows&mdash;a rather commonplace region now,
given over to humdrum folk intent on digging a
living from the soil; but the other is an army of
peaks, a region of storms, a spread of dark and
tangled forests. In the one, shallow rivers trickle
on their sandy way to the Gulf of Mexico; from
the other, the waters rush, uniting to make the
mighty stream whose silt-laden floods are slowly
filling the Gulf of California.</p>
<p>If you stand on one of the great naked crests
which form the dividing wall, the rampart of
the plains, you can see the Colorado of tradition
to the west, still rolling in wave after wave of
stupendous altitudes, each range cutting into
the sky with a purple saw-tooth edge. The
landscape seems to contain nothing but rocks
and towering crags, a treasure-house for those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
who mine. But this is illusive. Between these
purple heights charming valleys wind and meadows
lie in which rich grasses grow and cattle feed.</p>
<p>On certain slopes&mdash;where the devastating
miners have not yet played their relentless game&mdash;dark
forests rise to the high, bold summits of
the chiefest mountains, and it is to guard these
timbered tracts, growing each year more valuable,
that the government has established its
Forest Service to protect and develop the wealth-producing
power of the watersheds.</p>
<p>Chief among the wooded areas of this mighty
inland empire of crag and stream is the Bear
Tooth Forest, containing nearly eight hundred
thousand acres of rock and trees, whose seat
of administration is Bear Tooth Springs, the
small town in which our young traveler found
himself.</p>
<p>He carefully explained to the landlord of the
Cottage Hotel that he had never been in this
valley before, and that he was filled with astonishment
and delight of the scenery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scenery! Yes, too much scenery. What we
want is settlers,&#8221; retorted the landlord, who was
shabby and sour and rather contemptuous, for
the reason that he considered Norcross a poor
consumptive, and a fool to boot&mdash;&#8220;one of those
chaps who wait till they are nearly dead, then
come out here expecting to live on climate.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>The hotel was hardly larger than the log shanty
of a railway-grading camp; but the meat was
edible, and just outside the door roared Bear
Creek, which came down directly from Dome
Mountain, and the young Easterner went to
sleep beneath its singing that night. He should
have dreamed of the happy mountain girl, but
he did not; on the contrary, he imagined himself
back at college in the midst of innumerable
freshmen, yelling, &#8220;Bill McCoy, Bill McCoy!&#8221;</p>
<p>He woke a little bewildered by his strange surroundings,
and when he became aware of the
cheap bed, the flimsy wash-stand, the ugly wallpaper,
and thought how far he was from home
and friends, he not only sighed, he shivered.
The room was chill, the pitcher of water cold
almost to the freezing-point, and his joints
were stiff and painful from his ride. What
folly to come so far into the wilderness at this
time.</p>
<p>As he crawled from his bed and looked from
the window he was still further disheartened.
In the foreground stood a half dozen frame buildings,
graceless and cheap, without tree or shrub
to give shadow or charm of line&mdash;all was bare,
bleak, sere; but under his window the stream
was singing its glorious mountain song, and
away to the west rose the aspiring peaks from
which it came. Romance brooded in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
shadow, and on the lower foot-hills the frost-touched
foliage glowed like a mosaic of jewels.</p>
<p>Dressing hurriedly he went down to the small
bar-room, whose litter of duffle-bags, guns,
saddles, and camp utensils gave evidence of the
presence of many hunters and fishermen. The
slovenly landlord was poring over a newspaper,
while a discouraged half-grown youth was sludging
the floor with a mop; but a cheerful clamor
from an open door at the back of the hall told
that breakfast was on.</p>
<p>Venturing over the threshold, Norcross found
himself seated at table with some five or six men
in corduroy jackets and laced boots, who were,
in fact, merchants and professional men from
Denver and Pueblo out for fish and such game
as the law allowed, and all in holiday mood.
They joked the waiter-girls, and joshed one another
in noisy good-fellowship, ignoring the slim
youth in English riding-suit, who came in with
an air of mingled melancholy and timidity and
took a seat at the lower corner of the long table.</p>
<p>The landlady, tall, thin, worried, and inquisitive,
was New England&mdash;Norcross recognized her
type even before she came to him with a question
on her lips. &#8220;So you&#8217;re from the East, are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been at school there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to see you. My folks came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
from York State. I don&#8217;t often get any one from
the <i>real</i> East. Come out to fish, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, thinking this the easiest
way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;s plenty of fishing&mdash;and they&#8217;s
plenty of air, not much of anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he looked about the room, the tourist&#8217;s
eye was attracted by four young fellows seated
at a small table to his right. They wore rough
shirts of an olive-green shade, and their faces
were wind-scorched; but their voices held a
pleasant tone, and something in the manner of
the landlady toward them made them noticeable.
Norcross asked her who they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re forestry boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forestry boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the Supervisor&#8217;s office is here, and these
are his help.&#8221;</p>
<p>This information added to Norcross&#8217;s interest
and cheered him a little. He knew something of
the Forest Service, and had been told that many
of the rangers were college men. He resolved to
make their acquaintance. &#8220;If I&#8217;m to stay here
they will help me endure the exile,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After breakfast he went forth to find the post-office,
expecting a letter of instructions from
Meeker. He found nothing of the sort, and this
quite disconcerted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage is gone,&#8221; the postmistress told him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
&#8220;and you can&#8217;t get up till day after to-morrow.
You might reach Meeker by using the government
&#8217;phone, however.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will I find the government &#8217;phone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down in the Supervisor&#8217;s office. They&#8217;re
very accommodating; they&#8217;ll let you use it, if
you tell them who you want to reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was impossible to miss the forestry building
for the reason that a handsome flag fluttered
above it. The door being open, Norcross perceived
from the threshold a young clerk at work
on a typewriter, while in a corner close by the
window another and older man was working
intently on a map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the office of the Forest Supervisor?&#8221;
asked the youth.</p>
<p>The man at the machine looked up, and pleasantly
answered: &#8220;It is, but the Supervisor is not
in yet. Is there anything I can do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be you can. I am on my way to
Meeker&#8217;s Mill for a little outing. Perhaps you
could tell me where Meeker&#8217;s Mill is, and how
I can best get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man at the map meditated. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
far, some eighteen or twenty miles; but it&#8217;s over
a pretty rough trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a place is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very charming. You&#8217;ll like it. Real mountain
country.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>This officer was a plain-featured man of about
thirty-five, with keen and clear eyes. His voice,
though strongly nasal, possessed a note of manly
sincerity. As he studied his visitor, he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look brand-new&mdash;haven&#8217;t had time to
season-check, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m a stranger in a strange land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out for your health?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. My name is Norcross. I&#8217;m just getting
over a severe illness, and I&#8217;m up here to lay
around and fish and recuperate&mdash;if I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&mdash;you will. You can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; the
other assured him. &#8220;Join one of our surveying
crews for a week and I&#8217;ll mellow that suit of yours
and make a real mountaineer of you. I see you
wear a <i>Sigma Chi</i> pin. What was your school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a &#8216;Son of Eli.&#8217; Last year&#8217;s class.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man displayed his fob. &#8220;I&#8217;m ten
classes ahead of you. My name is Nash. I&#8217;m
what they call an &#8216;expert.&#8217; I&#8217;m up here doing
some estimating and surveying for a big ditch
they&#8217;re putting in. I was rather in hopes you
had come to join our ranks. We sons of Eli are
holding the conservation fort these days, and we
need help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My knowledge of your work is rather vague,&#8221;
admitted Norcross. &#8220;My father is in the lumber
business; but his point of view isn&#8217;t exactly
yours.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He slays &#8217;em, does he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did. He helped devastate Michigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After me the deluge! I know the kind. Why
not make yourself a sort of vicarious atonement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross smiled. &#8220;I had not thought of that.
It would help some, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly would. There&#8217;s no great money
in the work; but it&#8217;s about the most enlightened
of all the governmental bureaus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross was strongly drawn to this forester,
whose tone was that of a highly trained specialist.
&#8220;I rode up on the stage yesterday with
Miss Berrie McFarlane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Supervisor&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She seemed a fine Western type.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not a type; she&#8217;s an individual. She
hasn&#8217;t her like anywhere I&#8217;ve gone. She cuts a
wide swath up here. Being an only child she&#8217;s
both son and daughter to McFarlane. She
knows more about forestry than her father. In
fact, half the time he depends on her judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross was interested, but did not want to
take up valuable time. He said: &#8220;Will you let
me use your telephone to Meeker&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very sorry, but our line is out of order.
You&#8217;ll have to wait a day or so&mdash;or use the mails.
You&#8217;re too late for to-day&#8217;s stage, but it&#8217;s only
a short ride across. Come outside and I&#8217;ll show
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>Norcross followed him to the walk, and stood
in silence while his guide indicated the pass over
the range. It all looked very formidable to the
Eastern youth. Thunderous clouds hung low
upon the peaks, and the great crags to left and
right of the notch were stern and barren. &#8220;I
think I&#8217;ll wait for the stage,&#8221; he said, with candid
weakness. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make that trip alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take many such a ride over
that range in the <i>night</i>&mdash;if you join the service,&#8221;
Nash warningly replied.</p>
<p>As they were standing there a girl came galloping
up to the hitching-post and slid from
her horse. It was Berea McFarlane. &#8220;Good
morning, Emery,&#8221; she called to the surveyor.
&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; she nodded at Norcross. &#8220;How
do you find yourself this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Homesick,&#8221; he replied, smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed in the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so commonplace. I expected it to be&mdash;well,
different. It&#8217;s just like any other plains
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie looked round at the forlorn shops, the
irregular sidewalks, the grassless yards. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t very pretty, that&#8217;s a fact; but you can always
forget it by just looking up at the high
country. When you going up to the mill?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t had any word from
Meeker, and I can&#8217;t reach him by telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, the line is short-circuited somewhere;
but they&#8217;ve sent a man out. He may close it
any minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Supervisor?&#8221; asked Nash.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone over to Moore&#8217;s cutting. How
are you getting on with those plats?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I&#8217;ll have &#8217;em all in shape by
Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in and make yourself at home,&#8221; said
the girl to Norcross. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find the papers
two or three days old,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;We never
know about anything here till other people have
forgotten it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross followed her into the office, curious
to know more about her. She was so changed
from his previous conception of her that he was
puzzled. She had the directness and the brevity
of phrase of a business man, as she opened letters
and discussed their contents with the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly she <i>is</i> different,&#8221; thought Norcross, and
yet she lost something by reason of the display
of her proficiency as a clerk. &#8220;I wish she would
leave business to some one else,&#8221; he inwardly
grumbled as he rose to go.</p>
<p>She looked up from her desk. &#8220;Come in
again later. We may be able to reach the mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thanked her and went back to his hotel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
where he overhauled his outfit and wrote some
letters. His disgust of the town was lessened by
the presence of that handsome girl, and the hope
that he might see her at luncheon made him
impatient of the clock.</p>
<p>She did not appear in the dining-room, and
when Norcross inquired of Nash whether she
took her meals at the hotel or not, the expert replied:
&#8220;No, she goes home. The ranch is only
a few miles down the valley. Occasionally we
invite her, but she don&#8217;t think much of the
cooking.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the young surveyors put in a word:
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think she would. I&#8217;d ride ten miles
any time to eat one of Mrs. McFarlane&#8217;s dinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Nash with a reflective look in
his eyes. &#8220;She&#8217;s a mighty fine girl, and I join
the boys in wishing her better luck than marrying
Cliff Belden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it settled that way?&#8221; asked Norcross.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the Supervisor warned us all, but even
he never has any good words for Belden. He&#8217;s
a surly cuss, and violently opposed to the service.
His brother is one of the proprietors of
the Meeker mill, and they have all tried to bulldoze
Landon, our ranger over there. By the
way, you&#8217;ll like Landon. He&#8217;s a Harvard man,
and a good ranger. His shack is only a half-mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
from Meeker&#8217;s house. It&#8217;s a pretty well-known
fact that Alec Belden is part proprietor
of a saloon over there that worries the Supervisor
worse than anything. Cliff swears he&#8217;s not connected
with it; but he&#8217;s more or less sympathetic
with the crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross, already deeply interested in the
present and future of a girl whom he had met
for the first time only the day before, was quite
ready to give up his trip to Meeker. After the
men went back to work he wandered about the
town for an hour or two, and then dropped in
at the office to inquire if the telephone line had
been repaired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s still dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Miss McFarlane return?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. She said she had work to do at home.
This is ironing-day, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She plays all the parts, don&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She sure does; and she plays one part as
well as another. She can rope and tie a steer
or bake a cake as well as play the piano.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me she plays the piano!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash laughed. &#8220;She does; but it&#8217;s one of
those you operate with your feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m relieved to hear that. She seems almost
weirdly gifted as it is.&#8221; After a moment he
broke in with: &#8220;What can a man do in this town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Work, nothing else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do for amusement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once in a while there is a dance in the hall
over the drug-store, and on Sunday you can listen
to a wretched sermon in the log church. The
rest of the time you work or loaf in the saloons&mdash;or
read. Old Nature has done her part here.
But man&mdash;! Ever been in the Tyrol?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, some day the people of the plains will
have sense enough to use these mountains, these
streams, the way they do over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It required only a few hours for Norcross to
size up the valley and its people. Aside from
Nash and his associates, and one or two families
connected with the mill to the north, the villagers
were poor, thriftless, and uninteresting. They
were lacking in the picturesque quality of ranchers
and miners, and had not yet the grace of
town-dwellers. They were, indeed, depressingly
nondescript.</p>
<p>Early on the second morning he went to the
post-office&mdash;which was also the telephone station&mdash;to
get a letter or message from Meeker. He
found neither; but as he was standing in the door
undecided about taking the stage, Berea came
into town riding a fine bay pony, and leading a
blaze-face buckskin behind her.</p>
<p>Her face shone cordially, as she called out:
&#8220;Well, how do you stack up this morning?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tip-top,&#8221; he answered, in an attempt to
match her cheery greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like our town better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit! But the hills are magnificent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody turned up from the mill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t heard a word from there. The
telephone is still out of commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t locate the break. Uncle Joe sent
word by the stage-driver asking us to keep an eye
out for you and send you over. I&#8217;ve come to
take you over myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty good of you; but it&#8217;s a good
deal to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see Uncle Joe on business, anyhow,
and you&#8217;ll like the ride better than the journey
by stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the horses standing with their bridle-reins
hanging on the ground, she led the way to
the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;When father comes in, tell him where I&#8217;ve
gone, and send Mr. Norcross&#8217;s packs by the first
wagon. Is your outfit ready?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. I can get it ready soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried away in pleasant excitement, and
in twenty minutes was at the door ready to ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take my bay,&#8221; said Berea.
&#8220;Old Paint-face there is a little notional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross approached his mount with a caution
which indicated that he had at least been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
instructed in range-horse psychology, and as he
gathered his reins together to mount, Berrie
remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re saddle-wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a few lessons in a riding-school,&#8221; he
replied, modestly.</p>
<p>Young Downing approached the girl with a
low-voiced protest: &#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to ride old
Paint. He nearly pitched the Supervisor the
other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried,&#8221; she said, and swung to her
saddle.</p>
<p>The ugly beast made off in a tearing sidewise
rush, but she smilingly called back: &#8220;All set.&#8221;
And Norcross followed her in high admiration.</p>
<p>Eventually she brought her bronco to subjection,
and they trotted off together along the
wagon-road quite comfortably. By this time
the youth had forgotten his depression, his homesickness
of the morning. The valley was again
enchanted ground. Its vistas led to lofty
heights. The air was regenerative, and though
a part of this elation was due, no doubt, to the
power of his singularly attractive guide, he laid
it discreetly to the climate.</p>
<p>After shacking along between some rather
sorry fields of grain for a mile or two, Berea
swung into a side-trail. &#8220;I want you to meet
my mother,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>The grassy road led to a long, one-story, half-log,
half-slab house, which stood on the bank
of a small, swift, willow-bordered stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our ranch,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;All the
meadow in sight belongs to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young Easterner looked about in astonishment.
Not a tree bigger than his thumb gave
shade. The gate of the cattle corral stood but
a few feet from the kitchen door, and rusty beef-bones,
bleaching skulls, and scraps of sun-dried
hides littered the ground or hung upon the fence.
Exteriorly the low cabin made a drab, depressing
picture; but as he alighted&mdash;upon Berea&#8217;s invitation&mdash;and
entered the house, he was met by
a sweet-faced, brown-haired little woman in a
neat gown, whose bearing was not in the least
awkward or embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Norcross, the tourist I told you
about,&#8221; explained Berrie.</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane extended her small hand with
friendly impulse. &#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to meet you,
sir. Are you going to spend some time at the
Mill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I have a letter to Mr. Meeker
from a friend of mine who hunted with him last
year&mdash;a Mr. Sutler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sutler! Oh, we know him very well.
Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>The interior of the house was not only well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
kept, but presented many evidences of refinement.
A mechanical piano stood against the
log wall, and books and magazines, dog-eared
with use, littered the table; and Norcross, feeling
the force of Nash&#8217;s half-expressed criticism of his
&#8220;superior,&#8221; listened intently to Mrs. McFarlane&#8217;s
apologies for the condition of the farmyard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Berea, sharply, &#8220;if we&#8217;re to reach
Uncle Joe&#8217;s for dinner we&#8217;d better be scratching
the hills.&#8221; And to her mother she added: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
pull in about dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother offered no objection to her daughter&#8217;s
plan, and the young people rode off together
directly toward the high peaks to the
east.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going by way of the cut-off,&#8221; Berrie explained;
and Norcross, content and unafraid,
nodded in acquiescence. &#8220;Here is the line,&#8221; she
called a few minutes later, pointing at a sign
nailed to a tree at the foot of the first wooded hill.</p>
<p>The notice, printed in black ink on a white
square of cloth, proclaimed this to be the boundary
of the Bear Tooth National Forest, and
pleaded with all men to be watchful of fires.
Its tone was not at all that of a strong government;
it was deprecatory.</p>
<p>The trail, hardly more than a wood road, grew
wilder and lonelier as they climbed. Cattle fed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
on the hillsides in scattered bands like elk. Here
and there a small cabin stood on the bank of a
stream; but, for the most part, the trail mounted
the high slopes in perfect solitude.</p>
<p>The girl talked easily and leisurely, reading
the brands of the ranchers, revealing the number
of cattle they owned, quite as a young farmer
would have done. She seemed not to be embarrassed
in the slightest degree by the fact that
she was guiding a strange man over a lonely road,
and gave no outward sign of special interest in
him till she suddenly turned to ask: &#8220;What kind
of a slicker&mdash;I mean a raincoat&mdash;did you bring?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked blank. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I brought
any. I&#8217;ve a leather shooting-jacket, however.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and looked up at
the sky. &#8220;We&#8217;re in for a storm. You&#8217;d ought &#8217;o
have a slicker, no fancy &#8216;raincoat,&#8217; but a real
old-fashioned cow-puncher&#8217;s oilskin. They make
a business of shedding rain. Leather&#8217;s no good,
neither is canvas; I&#8217;ve tried &#8217;em all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rode on for a few minutes in silence, as if
disgusted with his folly, but she was really worrying
about him. &#8220;Poor chap,&#8221; she said to herself.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t stand a chill. I ought to have thought
of his slicker myself. He&#8217;s helpless as a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were climbing fast now, winding upward
along the bank of a stream, and the sky had
grown suddenly gray, and the woodland path was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
dark and chill. The mountains were not less
beautiful; but they were decidedly less amiable,
and the youth shivered, casting an apprehensive
eye at the thickening clouds.</p>
<p>Berea perceived something of his dismay, and,
drawing rein, dismounted. Behind her saddle
was a tightly rolled bundle which, being untied
and shaken out, proved to be a horseman&#8217;s rainproof
oilskin coat. &#8220;Put this on!&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;I can&#8217;t take your
coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes you can! You must! Don&#8217;t you worry
about me, I&#8217;m used to weather. Put this on
over your jacket and all. You&#8217;ll need it. Rain
won&#8217;t hurt <i>me</i>; but it will just about finish
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The worst of this lay in its truth, and Norcross
lost all his pride of sex for the moment. A wetting
would not dim this girl&#8217;s splendid color, nor
reduce her vitality one degree, while to him it
might be a death-warrant. &#8220;You could throw
me over my own horse,&#8221; he admitted, in a kind
of bitter admiration, and slipped the coat on,
shivering with cold as he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think me a poor excuse of a trailer, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he said, ruefully, as the thunder began to
roll.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be all made over new,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
replied, tolerantly. &#8220;Stay here a year and you&#8217;ll
be able to stand anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remounting, she again led the way with cheery
cry. The rain came dashing down in fitful,
misty streams; but she merely pulled the rim of
her sombrero closer over her eyes, and rode
steadily on, while he followed, plunged in gloom
as cold and gray as the storm. The splitting
crashes of thunder echoed from the high peaks
like the voices of siege-guns, and the lightning
stabbed here and there as though blindly seeking
some hidden foe. Long veils of falling water
twisted and trailed through the valleys with
swishing roar.</p>
<p>&#8220;These mountain showers don&#8217;t last long,&#8221;
the girl called back, her face shining like a rose.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll get the sun in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it turned out. In less than an hour
they rode into the warm light again, and in spite
of himself Norcross returned her smile, though
he said: &#8220;I feel like a selfish fool. You are
soaked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly wet through,&#8221; she reassured him.
&#8220;My jacket and skirt turn water pretty well.
I&#8217;ll be dry in a jiffy. It does a body good to be
wet once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shame of his action remained; but a closer
friendship was established, and as he took off
the coat and handed it back to her, he again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
apologized. &#8220;I feel like a pig. I don&#8217;t see how
I came to do it. The thunder and the chill
scared me, that&#8217;s the truth of it. You hypnotized
me into taking it. How wet you <i>are</i>!&#8221;
he exclaimed, remorsefully. &#8220;You&#8217;ll surely take
cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never take cold,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;I&#8217;m used
to all kinds of weather. Don&#8217;t you bother about
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Topping a low divide the youth caught a
glimpse of the range to the southeast, which
took his breath. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that superb!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s like the shining roof of the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the Continental Divide,&#8221; she
confirmed, casually; but the lyrical note which
he struck again reached her heart. The men she
knew had so few words for the beautiful in life.
She wondered whether this man&#8217;s illness had
given him this refinement or whether it was
native to his kind. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad he took my coat,&#8221;
was her thought.</p>
<p>She pushed on down the slope, riding hard,
but it was nearly two o&#8217;clock when they drew
up at Meeker&#8217;s house, which was a long, low,
stone structure built along the north side of the
road. The place was distinguished not merely
by its masonry, but also by its picket fence,
which had once been whitewashed. Farm-wagons
of various degrees of decay stood by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
gate, and in the barn-yard plows and harrows&mdash;deeply
buried by the weeds&mdash;were rusting forlornly
away. A little farther up the stream the
tall pipe of a sawmill rose above the firs.</p>
<p>A pack of dogs of all sizes and signs came clamoring
to the fence, followed by a big, slovenly
dressed, red-bearded man of sixty or thereabouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Uncle Joe,&#8221; called the girl, in offhand
boyish fashion. &#8220;How are you <i>to-day</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, girl,&#8221; answered Meeker, gravely.
&#8220;What brings you up here this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a boarder who wants
to learn how to raise cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeker&#8217;s face lightened. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re
Mr. Norcross? I&#8217;m glad to see ye. Light off
and make yourself to home. Turn your horses
into the corral, the boys will feed &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I in America?&#8221; Norcross asked himself,
as he followed the slouchy old rancher into the
unkempt yard. &#8220;This certainly is a long way
from New Haven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without ceremony Meeker led his guests directly
into the dining-room, a long and rather
narrow room, wherein a woman and six or seven
roughly dressed young men were sitting at a
rudely appointed table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earth and seas!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Meeker.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s Berrie, and I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s Sutler&#8217;s friend,
our boarder.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what, mother,&#8221; admitted her husband.
&#8220;Berrie brought him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d ought &#8217;o gone for him yourself, you
big lump,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Meeker, who was as big as her husband,
greeted Norcross warmly, and made a place for
him beside her own chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Highst along there, boys, and give the company
a chance,&#8221; she commanded, sharply. &#8220;Our
dinner&#8217;s turrible late to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys&mdash;they were in reality full-grown cubs
of eighteen or twenty&mdash;did as they were bid with
much noise, chaffing Berrie with blunt humor.
The table was covered with a red oil-cloth,
and set with heavy blue-and-white china. The
forks were two-tined, steel-pronged, and not
very polished, and the food was of the simplest
sort; but the girl seemed at home there&mdash;as she
did everywhere&mdash;and was soon deep in a discussion
of the price of beef, and whether it was
advisable to ship now or wait a month.</p>
<p>Meeker read Sutler&#8217;s letter, which Norcross
had handed him, and, after deliberation, remarked:
&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll do the best we can
for you, Mr. Norcross; but we haven&#8217;t any fancy
accommodations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t expect any,&#8221; replied Berrie. &#8220;What
he needs is a little roughing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plinty of that to be had,&#8221; said one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the herders, who sat below the salt. &#8220;&#8217;is
the soft life I&#8217;m nadin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pat&#8217;s strong on soft jobs,&#8221; said another; and
Berea joined the laugh which followed this pointless
joke. She appeared to be one of them, and
it troubled Norcross a little. She had so little
the sex feeling and demanded so few of the rights
and privileges of a girl. The men all admired
her, that was evident, almost too evident, and
one or two of the older men felt the charm of her
young womanhood too deeply even to meet her
eyes; but of this Norcross was happily ignorant.
Already in these two days he had acquired a distinct
sense of proprietorship in her, a feeling
which made him jealous of her good name.</p>
<p>Meeker, it turned out, was an Englishman by
way of Canada, and this was his second American
wife. His first had been a sister to Mrs. McFarlane.
He was a man of much reading&mdash;of the
periodical sort&mdash;and the big sitting-room was
littered with magazines both English and American,
and his talk abounded in radical and rather
foolish utterances. Norcross considered it the
most disorderly home he had ever seen, and yet
it was not without a certain dignity. The rooms
were large and amply provided with furniture
of a very mixed and gaudy sort, and the table
was spread with abundance.</p>
<p>One of the lads, Frank Meeker, a dark, intense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
youth of about twenty, was Berea&#8217;s full cousin.
The others were merely hired hands, but they
all eyed the new-comer with disfavor. The fact
that Berrie had brought him and that she seemed
interested in him added to the effect of the smart
riding-suit which he wore. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to roll him
in the creek,&#8221; muttered one of them to his
neighbor.</p>
<p>This dislike Berrie perceived&mdash;in some degree&mdash;and
to Frank she privately said: &#8220;Now
you fellows have got to treat Mr. Norcross
right. He&#8217;s been very sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank maliciously grinned. &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll treat
him <i>right</i>. We won&#8217;t do a thing to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Frank,&#8221; she warned, &#8220;if you try any
of your tricks on him you&#8217;ll hear from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why all this worry on your part?&#8221; he asked,
keenly. &#8220;How long since you found him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We rode up on the stage day before yesterday,
and he seemed so kind o&#8217; blue and lonesome
I couldn&#8217;t help trying to chirk him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How will Cliff take all this chirking business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cliff ain&#8217;t my guardian&mdash;yet,&#8221; she laughingly
responded. &#8220;Mr. Norcross is a college man,
and not used to our ways&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mister</i> Norcross&mdash;what&#8217;s his front name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wayland.&#8221;</p>
<p>He snorted. &#8220;Wayland! If he gets past us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
without being called &#8216;pasty&#8217; he&#8217;s in luck. He&#8217;s
a &#8216;lunger&#8217; if there ever was one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was shrewd enough to see that the
more she sought to soften the wind to her Eastern
tenderfoot the more surely he was to be
shorn, so she gave over her effort in that direction,
and turned to the old folks. To Mrs.
Meeker she privately said: &#8220;Mr. Norcross ain&#8217;t
used to rough ways, and he&#8217;s not very rugged,
you ought &#8217;o kind o&#8217; favor him for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl herself did not understand the vital
and almost painful interest which this young
man had roused in her. He was both child and
poet to her, and as she watched him trying to
make friends with the men, her indignation rose
against their clownish offishness. She understood
fully that his neat speech, his Eastern accent,
together with his tailor-cut clothing and
the delicacy of his table manners, would surely
mark him for slaughter among the cow-hands,
and the wish to shield him made her face graver
than anybody had ever seen it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel right in leaving you here,&#8221; she
said, at last; &#8220;but I must be ridin&#8217;.&#8221; And while
Meeker ordered her horse brought out, she walked
to the gate with Norcross at her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tremendously obliged to you,&#8221; he said,
and his voice was vibrant. &#8220;You have been
most kind. How can I repay you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she replied, in true Western
fashion. &#8220;I wanted to see the folks up here,
anyhow. This is no jaunt at all for me.&#8221; And,
looking at her powerful figure, and feeling the
trap-like grip of her cinch hand, he knew she
spoke the truth.</p>
<p>Frank had saddled his own horse, and was
planning to ride over the hill with her; but to
this she objected. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave Pete
here for Mr. Norcross to ride,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
there&#8217;s no need of your going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s face soured, and with instant perception
of the effect her refusal might have on the
fortunes of the stranger, she reconsidered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come along! I reckon you want to get
shut of some mean job.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so she rode away, leaving her ward to adjust
himself to his new and strange surroundings
as best he could, and with her going the whole
valley darkened for the convalescent.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>WAYLAND RECEIVES A WARNING</h3>
</div>

<p>Distance is no barrier to gossip. It
amazed young Norcross to observe how
minutely the ranchers of the valley followed one
another&#8217;s most intimate domestic affairs. Not
merely was each man in full possession of the
color and number of every calf in his neighbor&#8217;s
herd, it seemed that nothing could happen in
the most remote cabin and remain concealed.
Any event which broke the monotony of their
life loomed large, and in all matters of courtship
curiosity was something more than keen, it was
remorseless.</p>
<p>Living miles apart, and riding the roads but
seldom, these lonely gossips tore to tatters every
scrap of rumor. No citizen came or went without
being studied, characterized, accounted for,
and every woman was scrutinized as closely as
a stray horse, and if there was within her, the
slightest wayward impulse some lawless centaur
came to know it, to exult over it, to make test
of it. Her every word, her minutest expression
of a natural coquetry was enlarged upon as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
sign of weakness, of yielding. Every personable
female was the focus of a natural desire, intensified
by lonely brooding on the part of the men.</p>
<p>It was soon apparent to the Eastern observer
that the entire male population for thirty miles
around not only knew McFarlane&#8217;s girl; but
that every unmarried man&mdash;and some who were
both husbands and fathers&mdash;kept a deeply interested
eye upon her daily motion, and certain
shameless ones openly boasted among their fellows
of their intention to win her favor, while
the shy ones reveled in secret exultation over
every chance meeting with her. She was the
topic of every lumber-camp, and the shining lure
of every dance to which the ranch hands often
rode over long and lonely trails.</p>
<p>Part of this intense interest was due, naturally,
to the scarcity of desirable women, but a larger
part was called out by Berea&#8217;s frank freedom of
manner. Her ready camaraderie was taken for
carelessness, and the candid grip of her hand was
often misunderstood; and yet most of the men
respected her, and some feared her. After her
avowed choice of Clifford Belden they all kept
aloof, for he was hot-tempered and formidably
swift to avenge an insult.</p>
<p>At the end of a week Norcross found himself
restless and discontented with the Meekers. He
was tired of fishing, tired of the old man&#8217;s endless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
arguments, and tired of the obscene cow-hands.
The men around the mill did not interest
him, and their Saturday night spree at the
saloon disgusted him. The one person who
piqued his curiosity was Landon, the ranger who
was stationed not far away, and who could be
seen occasionally riding by on a handsome black
horse. There was something in his bearing, in
his neat and serviceable drab uniform, which
attracted the convalescent, and on Sunday morning
he decided to venture a call, although Frank
Meeker had said the ranger was a &#8220;grouch.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cabin, a neat log structure, stood just
above the road on a huge natural terrace of
grassy boulders, and the flag which fluttered from
a tall staff before it could be seen for several
miles&mdash;the bright sign of federal control, the
symbol of law and order, just as the saloon and
the mill were signs of lawless vice and destructive
greed. Around the door flowers bloomed and
kittens played; while at the door of the dive
broken bottles, swarms of flies, and heaps of
refuse menaced every corner, and the mill immured
itself in its own debris like a foul beast.</p>
<p>It was strangely moving to come upon this
flower-like place and this garden in the wilderness.
A spring, which crept from the high wall
back of &#8220;the station&#8221; (as these ranger headquarters
are called), gave its delicious water into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
several winding ditches, trickled musically down
the other side of the terrace in little life-giving
cascades, and so finally, reunited in a single current,
fell away into the creek. It was plain that
loving care, and much of it, had been given to
this tiny system of irrigation.</p>
<p>The cabin&#8217;s interior pleased Wayland almost as
much as the garden. It was built of pine logs
neatly matched and hewed on one side. There
were but two rooms&mdash;one which served as sleeping-chamber
and office, and one which was at
once kitchen and dining-room. In the larger
room a quaint fireplace with a flat arch, a bunk, a
table supporting a typewriter, and several shelves
full of books made up the furnishing. On the
walls hung a rifle, a revolver in its belt, a couple
of uniforms, and a yellow oilskin raincoat.</p>
<p>The ranger, spurred and belted, with his cuffs
turned back, was pounding the typewriter when
Wayland appeared at the open door; but he rose
with grave courtesy. &#8220;Come in,&#8221; he said, and
his voice had a pleasant inflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interrupting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing serious, just a letter. There&#8217;s no
hurry. I&#8217;m always glad of an excuse to rest
from this job.&#8221; He was at once keenly interested
in his visitor, for he perceived in him the gentleman
and, of course, the alien.</p>
<p>Wayland, with something of the feeling of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
civilian reporting to an officer, explained his
presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you,&#8221; responded the ranger,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve been hoping you&#8217;d look in on me. The
Supervisor&#8217;s daughter has just written me to
look after you. She said you were not very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Wayland protested that he was not a
consumptive, only a student who needed mountain
air; but he added: &#8220;It is very kind of Miss
McFarlane to think of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she thinks of everybody,&#8221; the young fellow
declared. &#8220;She&#8217;s one of the most unselfish
creatures in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in the music of this speech, and
something in the look of the ranger&#8217;s eyes,
caused Wayland to wonder if here were not
still another of Berrie&#8217;s subjects. He became
certain of it as the young officer went on, with
pleasing frankness, and it was not long before
he had conveyed to Wayland his cause for sadness.
&#8220;She&#8217;s engaged to a man that is not her
equal. In a certain sense no man is her equal;
but Belden is a pretty hard type, and I believe,
although I can&#8217;t prove it, that he is part owner of
the saloon over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does that saloon happen to be here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on patented land&mdash;a so-called &#8216;placer
claim&#8217;&mdash;experts have reported against it. McFarlane
has protested against it, but nothing is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
done. The mill is also on deeded land, and
together they are a plague spot. I&#8217;m their
enemy, and they know it; and they&#8217;ve threatened
to burn me out. Of course they won&#8217;t do that,
but they&#8217;re ready to play any kind of trick on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can well believe that, for I am getting my
share of practical jokes at Meeker&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not a bad lot over there&mdash;only just
rowdy. I suppose they&#8217;re initiating you,&#8221; said
Landon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come out here to be a cowboy,&#8221; responded
Norcross. &#8220;But Frank Meeker seems
to be anxious to show me all the good old cowboy
courtesies. On Monday he slipped a burr
under my horse&#8217;s saddle, and I came near to
having my neck broken. Then he or some one
else concealed a frog in my bed, and fouled my
hair-brushes. In fact, I go to sleep each night
in expectation of some new attack; but the air
and the riding are doing me a great deal of good,
and so I stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and bunk with me,&#8221; urged Landon.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to have you. I get terribly lonesome
here sometimes, although I&#8217;m supposed
to have the best station in the forest. Bring
your outfit and stay as long as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>This offer touched Norcross deeply. &#8220;That&#8217;s
very kind of you; but I guess I&#8217;ll stick it out.
I hate to let those hoodlums drive me out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, but come and see me often. I get
so blue some days I wonder what&#8217;s the use of it
all. There&#8217;s one fatal condition about this
ranger business&mdash;it&#8217;s a solitary job, it cuts out
marriage for most of us. Many of the stations are
fifteen or twenty miles from a post-office; then,
too, the lines of promotion are few. I guess I&#8217;ll
have to get out, although I like the work. Come
in any time and take a snack with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereafter Wayland spent nearly every day
with the ranger, either in his cabin or riding
the trail, and during these hours confidence grew
until at last Landon confessed that his unrest
arose from his rejection by Berrie.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was not to blame. She&#8217;s so kind and
free with every one, I thought I had a chance.
I was conceited enough to feel sorry for the other
fellows, and now I can&#8217;t even feel sorry for myself.
I&#8217;m just dazed and hanging to the ropes.
She was mighty gentle about it&mdash;you know how
sunny her face is&mdash;well, she just got grave and
kind o&#8217; faint-voiced, and said&mdash;Oh, you know
what she said! She let me know there was another
man. I didn&#8217;t ask her who, and when I
found out, I lost my grip entirely. At first I
thought I&#8217;d resign and get out of the country;
but I couldn&#8217;t do it&mdash;I can&#8217;t yet. The chance
of seeing her&mdash;of hearing from her once in a
while&mdash;she never writes except on business for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
her father; but&mdash;you&#8217;ll laugh&mdash;I can&#8217;t see her
signature without a tremor.&#8221; He smiled, but
his eyes were desperately sad. &#8220;I ought to resign,
because I can&#8217;t do my work as well as I
ought to. As I ride the trail I&#8217;m thinking of
her. I sit here half the night writing imaginary
letters to her. And when I see her, and she
takes my hand in hers&mdash;you know what a hand
she has&mdash;my mind goes blank. Oh, I&#8217;m crazy!
I admit it. I didn&#8217;t know such a thing could
happen to me; but it has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s being alone so much,&#8221; Wayland
started to argue, but the other would not have
it so.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s the girl herself. She&#8217;s not only beautiful
in body, she&#8217;s all sweetness and sincerity
in mind. There isn&#8217;t a petty thing about her.
And her happy smile&mdash;do you know, I have
times when I resent that smile? How can she be
so happy without me? That&#8217;s crazy, too, but I
think it, sometimes. Then I think of the time
when she will not smile&mdash;when that brute Belden
will begin to treat her as he does his sisters&mdash;then
I get murderous.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Wayland listened to this outpouring he
wondered at the intensity of the forester&#8217;s passion.
He marveled, too, at Berrie&#8217;s choice, for
there was something fine and high in Landon&#8217;s
worship. A college man with a mining engineer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
training, he should go high in the service. &#8220;He
made the mistake of being too precipitate as a
lover,&#8221; concluded Wayland. &#8220;His forthright
courtship repelled her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile his own troubles increased. Frank&#8217;s
dislike had grown to an impish vindictiveness,
and if the old man Meeker had any knowledge of
his son&#8217;s deviltries, he gave no sign. Mrs.
Meeker, however, openly reproved the scamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of worrying a sick
man,&#8221; she protested, indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t so sick as all that; and, besides, he
needs the starch taken out of him,&#8221; was the
boy&#8217;s pitiless answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I stay,&#8221; Wayland wrote
to Berea. &#8220;I&#8217;m disgusted with the men up
here&mdash;they&#8217;re all tiresome except Landon&mdash;but
I hate to slink away, and besides, the country is
glorious. I&#8217;d like to come down and see you
this week. May I do so? Please send word
that I may.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply, and wondering whether she
had received his letter or not, he mounted his
horse one beautiful morning and rode away up the
trail with a sense of elation, of eager joy, with intent
to call upon her at the ranch as he went by.</p>
<p>Hardly had he vanished among the pines when
Clifford Belden rode in from his ranch on Hat
Creek, and called at Meeker&#8217;s for his mail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Frank Meeker was in the office, and as he
both feared and disliked this big contemptuous
young cattleman, he set to work to make him
jealous.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to watch this one-lung boarder
of ours,&#8221; he warned, with a grin. &#8220;He&#8217;s been
writing to Berrie, and he&#8217;s just gone down to
see her. His highfalutin ways, and his fine
white hands, have put her on the slant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belden fixed a pair of cold, gray-blue eyes on
his tormentor, and said: &#8220;You be careful of
your tongue or I&#8217;ll put <i>you</i> on the slant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m her own cousin,&#8221; retorted Frank. &#8220;I
reckon I can say what I please about her. I
don&#8217;t want that dude Easterner to cut you out.
She guided him over here, and gave him her
slicker to keep him dry, and I can see she&#8217;s
terribly taken with him. She&#8217;s headstrong as a
mule, once she gets started, and if she takes a
notion to Norcross it&#8217;s all up with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying,&#8221; retorted Belden.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better be. I was down there the
other day, and it &#8217;peared like she couldn&#8217;t talk
of anything else but Mister Norcross, Mister
Norcross, till I was sick of his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later Belden left the mill and set off
up the trail behind Norcross, his face fallen into
stern lines. Frank writhed in delight. &#8220;There
goes Cliff, hot under the collar, chasing Norcross.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
If he finds out that Berrie is interested in him,
he&#8217;ll just about wring that dude&#8217;s neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wayland was riding through the
pass with lightening heart, his thought dwelling
on the girl at the end of his journey. Aside from
Landon and Nash, she was the one soul in all
this mountain world in whom he took the slightest
interest. Her pity still hurt him, but he
hoped to show her such change of color, such
gain in horsemanship, that she could no longer
consider him an invalid. His mind kept so
closely to these interior matters that he hardly
saw the path, but his horse led him safely back
with precise knowledge and eager haste.</p>
<p>As he reached the McFarlane ranch it seemed
deserted of men, but a faint column of smoke
rising from the roof of the kitchen gave evidence
of a cook, and at his knock Berrie came to the
door with a boyish word of frank surprise and
pleasure. She was dressed in a blue-and-white
calico gown with the collar turned in and the
sleeves rolled up; but she seemed quite unembarrassed,
and her pleasure in his coming quite
repaid him for his long and tiresome ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering about you,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad to see you. How do you
stand it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got my letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did&mdash;and I was going to write and tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
to come down, but I&#8217;ve had some special work
to do at the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the horse&#8217;s rein from him, and together
they started toward the stables. As she
stepped over and around the old hoofs and meat-bones&mdash;which
littered the way&mdash;without comment,
Wayland again wondered at her apparent
failure to realize the disgusting disorder of the
yard. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t she urge the men to clean
it up?&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>This action of stabling the horses&mdash;a perfectly
innocent and natural one for her&mdash;led one
of the hands, a coarse-minded sneak, to watch
them from a corral. &#8220;I wonder how Cliff would
like that?&#8221; he evilly remarked.</p>
<p>Berea was frankly pleased to see Wayland,
and spoke of the improvement which had taken
place in him. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking fine,&#8221; she said,
as they were returning to the house. &#8220;But how
do you get on with the boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very well,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;They seem
to have it in for me. It&#8217;s a constant fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Frank?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the worst of them all. He never speaks
to me that he doesn&#8217;t insult me. I don&#8217;t know
why. I&#8217;ve tried my best to get into his good
graces, but I can&#8217;t. Your uncle I like, and Mrs.
Meeker is very kind; but all the others seem to
be sworn enemies. I don&#8217;t think I could stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
it if it weren&#8217;t for Landon. I spend a good deal
of time with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face grew grave. &#8220;I reckon you got
started wrong,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;They&#8217;ll like
you better when you get browned up, and your
clothes get dirty&mdash;you&#8217;re a little too fancy for
them just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying for
their admiration. I haven&#8217;t the slightest ambition
to shine as a cow-puncher, and if those fellows
are fair samples I don&#8217;t want anybody to
mistake me for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that get around,&#8221; she smilingly
replied. &#8220;They&#8217;d run you out if they knew you
despised them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come down here to confer with you,&#8221; he
declared, as they reached the door. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe I want any more of their company.
What&#8217;s the use? As you say, I&#8217;ve started wrong
with them, and I don&#8217;t see any prospect of getting
right; and, besides, I like the rangers better.
Landon thinks I might work into the service.
I wonder if I could? It would give me something
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She considered a moment. &#8220;We&#8217;ll think about
that. Come into the kitchen. I&#8217;m cook to-day,
mother&#8217;s gone to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kitchen was clean and ample, and the
delicious odor of new-made bread filled it with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
cheer. As the girl resumed her apron, Wayland
settled into a chair with a sigh of content.
&#8220;I like this,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
cowgirl about you now, you&#8217;re the Anglo-Saxon
housewife. You might be a Michigan or Connecticut
girl at this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cheeks were ruddy with the heat, and her
eyes intent on her work; but she caught enough
of his meaning to be pleased with it. &#8220;Oh, I
have to take a hand at the pots and pans now
and then. I can&#8217;t give all my time to the service;
but I&#8217;d like to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He boldly announced his errand. &#8220;I wish
you&#8217;d take me to board? I&#8217;m sure your cooking
would build up my shattered system a good deal
quicker than your aunt&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, but shook her head. &#8220;You
ought to be on the hills riding hard every day.
What you need is the high country and the air
of the pines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not feeling any lack of scenery or pine-tree
air,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly satisfied
right here. Civilized bread and the sight of you
will do me more good than boiled beans and
camp bread. I hate to say it, but the Meeker
menu runs largely to beef. Moreover, just seeing
you would help my recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>She became self-conscious at this, and he
hastened to add:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I&#8217;m really sick. Mrs. Meeker, like
yourself, persists in treating me as if I were.
I&#8217;m feeling fine&mdash;perfectly well, only I&#8217;m not as
rugged as I want to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had read that victims of the white plague
always talk in this cheerful way about themselves,
and she worked on without replying, and
this gave him an excellent opportunity to study
her closely. She was taller than most women
and lithely powerful. There was nothing delicate
about her&mdash;nothing spirituelle&mdash;on the contrary,
she was markedly full-veined, cheerful and humorous,
and yet she had responded several times
to an allusive phrase with surprising quickness.
She did so now as he remarked: &#8220;Somebody,
I think it was Lowell, has said &#8216;Nature is
all very well for a vacation, but a poor substitute
for the society of good men and women.&#8217; It&#8217;s
beautiful up at the mill, but I want some one
to enjoy it with, and there is no one to turn
to, except Landon, and he&#8217;s rather sad and self-absorbed&mdash;you
know why. If I were here&mdash;in
the valley&mdash;you and I could ride together
now and then, and you could show me all the
trails. Why not let me come here and board?
I&#8217;m going to ask your mother, if I may not do
so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite naturally he grew more and more personal.
He told her of his father, the busy director
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
of a lumber company, and of his mother,
sickly and inert.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought never to have married,&#8221; he said,
with darkened brow. &#8220;Not one of her children
has even a decent constitution. I&#8217;m the most
robust of them all, and I must seem a pretty
poor lot to you. However, I wasn&#8217;t always like
this, and if that young devil, Frank Meeker,
hadn&#8217;t tormented me out of my sleep, I would
have shown you still greater improvement.
Don&#8217;t you see that it is your duty to let me stay
here where I can build up on your cooking?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned this aside. &#8220;Mother don&#8217;t think
much of my cooking. She says I can handle a
brandin&#8217;-iron a heap better than I can a rollin&#8217;-pin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly can ride,&#8221; he replied, with admiring
accent. &#8220;I shall never forget the picture
you made that first time I saw you racing to intercept
the stage. Do you <i>know</i> how fine you
are physically? You&#8217;re a wonder.&#8221; She uttered
some protest, but he went on: &#8220;When I think of
my mother and sisters in comparison with you,
they seem like caricatures of women. I know
I oughtn&#8217;t to say such things of my mother&mdash;she
really is an exceptional person&mdash;but a woman
should be something more than mind. My
sisters could no more do what you do than a
lame duck can lead a ballet. I suppose it is because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
I have had to live with a lot of ailing women
all my life that I feel as I do toward you. I worship
your health and strength. I really do.
Your care of me on that trip was very sweet&mdash;and
yet it stung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m not complaining.
I&#8217;m only wishing I could come here and be &#8216;bossed&#8217;
by you until I could hold my own against any
weather. You make me feel just as I used to do
when I went to a circus and watched the athletes,
men and women, file past me in the sawdust.
They seemed like demigods. As I sit here now
I have a fierce desire to be as well, as strong, as
full of life as you are. I hate being thin and
timid. You have the physical perfection that
queens ought to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was flushed with inward heat as she
listened to his strange words, which sprang, she
feared, from the heart of a man hopelessly ill;
but she again protested. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right to be
able to throw a rope and ride a mean horse, but
you have got something else&mdash;something I can
never get. Learning is a thousand times finer
than muscle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Learning does not compensate for nine-inch
shoulders and spindle legs,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m going to get well. Knowing you has given
me renewed desire to be a man. I&#8217;m going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
ride and rough it, and sleep out of doors till I
can follow you anywhere. You&#8217;ll be proud of
me before the month is out. But I&#8217;m going to
cut the Meeker outfit. I won&#8217;t subject myself
to their vulgarities another day. Why should I?
It&#8217;s false pride in me to hang on up there any
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can come here,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Mother will be glad to have you, although our
ranch isn&#8217;t a bit pretty. Perhaps father will
send you out with one of the rangers as a fire-guard.
I&#8217;ll ask him to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would. I like these foresters.
What I&#8217;ve seen of them. I wouldn&#8217;t mind serving
under a man like Landon. He&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this pleasant conference Cliff Belden
unexpectedly burst. Pushing the door open
with a slam, he confronted Berrie with dark and
angry face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Cliff, where did you come from?&#8221; she
asked, rising in some confusion. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear
you ride up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently not,&#8221; he sneeringly answered.
&#8220;I reckon you were too much occupied.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to laugh away his black mood.
&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I was. I&#8217;m chief cook to-day.
Come in and sit down. Mother&#8217;s gone to town,
and I&#8217;m playing her part,&#8221; she explained, ignoring
his sullen displeasure. &#8220;Cliff, this is Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Norcross, who is visiting Uncle Joe. Mr. Norcross,
shake hands with Mr. Belden.&#8221; She made
this introduction with some awkwardness, for her
lover&#8217;s failure to even say, &#8220;Howdy,&#8221; informed
her that his jealous heart was aflame, and she
went on, quickly: &#8220;Mr. Norcross dropped in on
his way to the post-office, and I&#8217;m collecting a
snack for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recognizing Belden&#8217;s claims upon the girl,
Wayland rose. &#8220;I must be going. It&#8217;s a long
ride over the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come again soon,&#8221; urged Berrie; &#8220;father
wants to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I will look in very shortly,&#8221; he
replied, and went out with such dignity as he
could command, feeling, however, very much
like a dog that has been kicked over the threshold.</p>
<p>Closing the door behind him, Belden turned
upon the girl. &#8220;What&#8217;s that consumptive &#8216;dogie&#8217;
doing here? He &#8217;peared to be very much at
home with you&mdash;too dern much at home!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was prepared for his displeasure, but not
for words like these. She answered, quietly:
&#8220;He just dropped in on his way to town, and he&#8217;s
not a dogie!&#8221; She resented his tone as well as
his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about you taking him over to
Meeker&#8217;s and lending him your only slicker,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
went on; &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t expect to find him sittin&#8217;
here like he owned you and the place. You&#8217;re
taking altogether too much pains with him.
Can&#8217;t he put his own horse out? Do you have
to go to the stable with him? You never did
have any sense about your actions with men.
You&#8217;ve all along been too free of your reputation,
and now I&#8217;m going to take care of it for you. I
won&#8217;t have you nursin&#8217; this runt any longer!&#8221;</p>
<p>She perceived now the full measure of his base
rage, and her face grew pale and set. &#8220;You&#8217;re
making a perfect fool of yourself, Cliff,&#8221; she said,
with portentous calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure are, and you&#8217;ll see it yourself by
and by. You&#8217;ve no call to get wire-edged about
Mr. Norcross. He&#8217;s not very strong. He&#8217;s just
getting well of a long sickness. I knew a chill
would finish him, that&#8217;s why I gave him my
slicker. It didn&#8217;t hurt me, and maybe it saved
his life. I&#8217;d do it again if necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when did you start a hospital for
Eastern tenderfeet?&#8221; he sneered; then his tone
changed to one of downright command. &#8220;You
want to cut this all out, I tell you! I won&#8217;t have
any more of it! The boys up at the mill are all
talkin&#8217; about your interest in this little whelp,
and I&#8217;m getting the branding-iron from every
one I meet. Sam saw you go into the barn with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
that dude, and <i>that</i> would have been all over the
country to-morrow, if I hadn&#8217;t told him I&#8217;d sew
his mouth up if he said a word about it. Of
course, I don&#8217;t think you mean anything by this
coddlin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you,&#8221; she interrupted, with flaming,
quick, indignant fury. &#8220;That&#8217;s mighty nice
of you. I went to the barn to show Mr. Norcross
where to stall his horse. I didn&#8217;t know
Sam was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sneered: &#8220;No, I bet you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fired at this. &#8220;Come now! Spit it out!
Something nasty is in your mind. Go on!
What have I done? What makes you so hot?&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to weaken. &#8220;I don&#8217;t accuse you of
anything. I&mdash;but I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes you do&mdash;in your heart you distrust me&mdash;you
just as much as said so!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was losing his high air of command. &#8220;Never
mind what I said, Berrie, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She was blazing now. &#8220;But I <i>do</i> mind&mdash;I
mind a whole lot&mdash;I didn&#8217;t think it of you,&#8221; she
added, as she realized his cheapness, his coarseness.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose you could even <i>think</i>
such things of me. I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; she repeated,
and her tone hardened, &#8220;and I guess you&#8217;d better
pull out of here&mdash;for good. If you&#8217;ve no more
faith in me than that, I want you to go and never
come back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do! You&#8217;ve shown this yellow streak
before, and I&#8217;m tired of it. This is the limit.
I&#8217;m done with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood between tears and benumbing anger
now, and he was scared. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that,
Berrie!&#8221; he pleaded, trying to put his arm about
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep away from me!&#8221; She dashed his hands
aside. &#8220;I hate you. I never want to see you
again!&#8221; She ran into her own room and slammed
the door behind her.</p>
<p>Belden stood for a long time with his back
against the wall, the heat of his resentment
utterly gone, an empty, aching place in his heart.
He called her twice, but she made no answer,
and so, at last, he mounted his horse and rode
away.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>THE SUPERVISOR OF THE FOREST</h3>
</div>

<p>Young Norcross, much as he admired Berrie,
was not seeking to exchange her favor
for her lover&#8217;s enmity, and he rode away with an
uneasy feeling of having innocently made trouble
for himself, as well as for a fine, true-hearted girl.
&#8220;What a good friendly talk we were having,&#8221; he
said, regretfully, &#8220;and to think she is to marry
that big, scowling brute. How could she turn
Landon down for a savage like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was just leaving the outer gate when Belden
came clattering up and reined his horse
across the path and called out: &#8220;See here, you
young skunk, you&#8217;re a poor, white-livered tenderfoot,
and I can&#8217;t bust you as I would a full-grown
man, but I reckon you better not ride
this trail any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; inquired Wayland.</p>
<p>Belden glared. &#8220;Because I tell you so. Your
sympathy-hunting game has just about run into
the ground. You&#8217;ve worked this baby dodge
about long enough. You&#8217;re not so almighty sick
as you put up to be, and you&#8217;d better hunt some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
other cure for lonesomeness, or I&#8217;ll just about
cave your chest in.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this was shockingly plain talk for a slender
young scholar to listen to, but Norcross remained
calm. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re unnecessarily
excited,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I have no desire to
make trouble. I&#8217;m considering Miss Berea, who
is too fine to be worried by us.&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was conciliating, and the cowman,
in spite of himself, responded to it. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
I advise you to go. She was all right till you
came. Colorado&#8217;s a big place, and there are
plenty other fine ranges for men of your complaint&mdash;why
not try Routt County? This is
certain, you can&#8217;t stay in the same valley with
my girl. I serve notice of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making a prodigious ass of yourself,&#8221;
observed Wayland, with calm contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so&mdash;do you? Well, I&#8217;ll make a
jack-rabbit out of you if I find you on this ranch
again. You&#8217;ve worked on my girl in some way
till she&#8217;s jest about quit me. I don&#8217;t see how you
did it, you measly little pup, but you surely have
turned her against me!&#8221; His rage burst into
flame as he thought of her last words. &#8220;If you
were so much as half a man I&#8217;d break you in
two pieces right now; but you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re
nothing but a dead-on-the-hoof lunger, and
there&#8217;s nothing to do but run you out. So take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
this as your final notice. You straddle a horse
and head east and keep a-ridin&#8217;, and if I catch
you with my girl again, I&#8217;ll deal you a whole
hatful of misery&mdash;now that&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon, with a final glance of hate in his
face, he whirled his horse and galloped away,
leaving Norcross dumb with resentment, intermingled
with wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly the West is a dramatic country! Here
I am, involved in a lover&#8217;s wrath, and under
sentence of banishment, all within a month!
Well, I suppose there&#8217;s nothing to do but carry
out Belden&#8217;s orders. He&#8217;s the boss,&#8221; he said as
he rode on. &#8220;I wonder just what happened after
I left? Something stormy, evidently. She must
have given him a sharp rebuff, or he wouldn&#8217;t
have been so furious with me. Perhaps she even
broke her engagement with him. I sincerely hope
she did. She&#8217;s too good for him. That&#8217;s the
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, from point to point, he progressed till
with fine indignation he reached a resolution
to stay and meet whatever came. &#8220;I certainly
would be a timorous animal if I let myself be
scared into flight by that big bonehead,&#8221; he said
at last. &#8220;I have as much right here as he has,
and the law must protect me. It can&#8217;t be that
this country is entirely barbaric.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he felt very weak and very much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
depressed as he rode up the street of the little
town and dismounted at the hotel. The sidewalks
were littered with loafing cowboys and
lumber-jacks, and some of them quite openly
ridiculed his riding-breeches and his thin legs.
Others merely grinned, but in their grins lay
something more insulting than words. &#8220;To
them I am a poor thing,&#8221; he admitted; but as he
lifted his eyes to the mighty semicircular wall
of the Bear Tooth Range, over which the daily
storm was playing, he forgot his small worries.
What gorgeous pageantry! What life-giving air!
&#8220;If only civilized men and women possessed this
glorious valley, what a place it would be!&#8221; he
exclaimed, and in the heat of his indignant
contempt he would have swept the valley
clean.</p>
<p>As his eyes caught the flutter of the flag on
its staff above the Forest Service building, his
heart went out to the men who unselfishly
wrought beneath that symbol of federal unity
for the good of the future. &#8220;That is civilized,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;that is prophetic,&#8221; and alighted at the
door in a glow of confidence.</p>
<p>Nash, who was alone in the office, looked up
from his work. &#8220;Come in,&#8221; he called, heartily.
&#8220;Come in and report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;d like to do so; and may I
use your desk? I have a letter to write.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Make yourself at home. Take any desk you
like. The men are all out on duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very kind,&#8221; replied Wayland, gratefully.
There was something reassuring in this
greeting, and in the many signs of skill and
scientific reading which the place displayed. It
was like a bit of Washington in the midst of a
careless, slovenly, lawless mountain town, and
Norcross took his seat and wrote his letter with
a sense of proprietorship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting up an enthusiasm for the Service
just from hearing Alec Belden rave against it,&#8221;
he said a few minutes later, as he looked up from
his letter.</p>
<p>Nash grinned. &#8220;How did you like Meeker?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good man, but he has his peculiarities.
Belden is your real enemy. He is blue
with malignity&mdash;so are most of the cowmen I
met up there. I wish I could do something for
the Service. I&#8217;m a thoroughly up-to-date analytical
chemist and a passable mining engineer, and
my doctor says that for a year at least I must
work in the open air. <i>Is</i> there anything in this
Forest Service for a weakling like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash considered. &#8220;The Supervisor might put
you on as a temporary guard. I&#8217;ll speak to him
if you like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would. Tell him to forget the
pay. I&#8217;m not in need of money, but I do require
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
some incentive&mdash;something to do&mdash;something to
give me direction. It bores me stiff to fish, and
I&#8217;m sick of loafing. If McFarlane can employ me
I shall be happy. The country is glorious, but
I can&#8217;t live on scenery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can employ you, but you&#8217;ll have
to go on as fire-guard or something like that for
the first year. You see, the work is getting to
be more and more technical each year. As a
matter of fact&#8221;&mdash;here he lowered his voice a little&mdash;&#8220;McFarlane
is one of the old guard, and
will have to give way. He don&#8217;t know a thing
about forestry, and is too old to learn. His girl
knows more about it than he does. She helps
him out on office work, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland wondered a little at the freedom of
expression on the part of Nash; but said: &#8220;If
he runs his office as he runs his ranch he surely
is condemned to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where the girl comes in. She keeps
the boys in the office lined up and maintains
things in pretty fair shape. She knows the old
man is in danger of losing his job, and she&#8217;s doing
her best to hold him to it. She&#8217;s like a son to him
and he relies on her judgment when a close decision
comes up. But it&#8217;s only a matter of time
when he and all he represents must drift by.
This is a big movement we&#8217;re mixed with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to feel that that&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
take it up. It&#8217;s the only thing out here that interests
me&mdash;and I&#8217;ve got to do something. I
can&#8217;t loaf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you get Berrie to take up your case and
you&#8217;re all right. She has the say about who goes
on the force in this forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon before Wayland
started back to Meeker&#8217;s with intent to repack
his belongings and leave the ranch for good.
He had decided not to call at McFarlane&#8217;s, a
decision which came not so much from fear of
Clifford Belden as from a desire to shield Berea
from further trouble, but as he was passing the
gate, the girl rose from behind a clump of willows
and called to him: &#8220;Oh, Mr. Norcross! Wait
a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew rein, and, slipping from his horse,
approached her. &#8220;What is it, Miss Berrie?&#8221; he
asked, with wondering politeness.</p>
<p>She confronted him with gravity. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
late for you to cross the ridge. It&#8217;ll be dark long
before you reach the cut-off. You&#8217;d better not
try to make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can find my way,&#8221; he answered,
touched by her consideration. &#8220;I&#8217;m not so
helpless as I was when I came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same you mustn&#8217;t go on,&#8221; she insisted.
&#8220;Father told me to ask you to come in
and stay all night. He wants to meet you. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
was afraid you might ride by after what happened
to-day, and so I came up here to head
you off.&#8221; She took his horse by the rein, and
flashed a smiling glance up at him. &#8220;Come now,
do as the Supervisor tells you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;On second
thought, I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a good thing for
me to go home with you. It will only make
further trouble for&mdash;for us both.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was almost as direct as Belden had been.
&#8220;I know what you mean. I saw Cliff follow you.
He jumped you, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He overtook me&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated. &#8220;He was pretty hot, and said
things he&#8217;ll be sorry for when he cools off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told you not to come here any more&mdash;advised
you to hit the out-going trail&mdash;didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>He flushed with returning shame of it all, but
quietly answered: &#8220;Yes, he said something about
riding east.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day; but I guess I&#8217;d better keep away
from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;ve been very kind to me, and I
wouldn&#8217;t for the world do anything to hurt or
embarrass you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind about me,&#8221; she responded,
bluntly. &#8220;What happened this morning wasn&#8217;t
your fault nor mine. Cliff made a mighty coarse
play, something he&#8217;ll have to pay for. He knows
that right now. He&#8217;ll be back in a day or two
begging my pardon, and he won&#8217;t get it. Don&#8217;t
you worry about me, not for a minute&mdash;I can
take care of myself&mdash;I grew up that way, and
don&#8217;t you be chased out of the country by anybody.
Come, father will be looking for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a feeling that he was involving both the
girl and himself in still darker storms, the young
fellow yielded to her command, and together
they walked along the weed-bordered path,
while she continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the first time Cliff has started in
to discipline me; but it&#8217;s obliged to be the last.
He&#8217;s the kind that think they own a girl just as
soon as they get her to wear an engagement ring;
but Cliff don&#8217;t own me. I told him I wouldn&#8217;t
stand for his coarse ways, and I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland tried to bring her back to humor.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a kind of &#8216;new woman.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned a stern look on him. &#8220;You bet I
am! I was raised a free citizen. No man can
make a slave of me. I thought he understood
that; but it seems he didn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s all right in
many ways&mdash;one of the best riders in the country&mdash;but
he&#8217;s pretty tolerable domineering&mdash;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
always known that&mdash;still, I never expected him
to talk to me like he did to-day. It certainly
was raw.&#8221; She broke off abruptly. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t let Frank Meeker get the best of you,
either,&#8221; she advised. &#8220;He&#8217;s a mean little weasel
if he gets started. I&#8217;ll bet he put Cliff up to this
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he just as good as told me he&#8217;d do it.
I know Frank, he&#8217;s my own cousin, and someways
I like him; but he&#8217;s the limit when he gets going.
You see, he wanted to get even with Cliff and
took that way of doing it. I&#8217;ll ride up there and
give him a little good advice some Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was no longer amused by her blunt speech,
and her dark look saddened him. She seemed
so unlike the happy girl he met that first day,
and the change in her subtended a big, rough,
and pitiless world of men against which she was
forced to contend all her life.</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane greeted Norcross with cordial
word and earnest hand-clasp. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see
you looking so well,&#8221; she said, with charming sincerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m browner, anyway,&#8221; he answered, and
turned to meet McFarlane, a short, black-bearded
man, with fine dark eyes and shapely hands&mdash;hands
that had never done anything more toilsome
than to lift a bridle rein or to clutch the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
handle of a gun. He was the horseman in all
his training, and though he owned hundreds of
acres of land, he had never so much as held a
plow or plied a spade. His manner was that of
the cow-boss, the lord of great herds, the claimant
of empires of government grass-land. Poor
as his house looked, he was in reality rich. Narrow-minded
in respect to his own interests, he
was well in advance of his neighbors on matters
relating to the general welfare, a curious mixture
of greed and generosity, as most men are,
and though he had been made Supervisor at
a time when political pull still crippled the Service,
he was loyal to the flag. &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad
to see you,&#8221; he heartily began. &#8220;We don&#8217;t often
get a man from the sea-level, and when we do we
squeeze him dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice, low, languid, and soft, was most
insinuating, and for hours he kept his guest talking
of the East and its industries and prejudices;
and Berrie and her mother listened with deep
admiration, for the youngster had seen a good
deal of the old world, and was unusually well
read on historical lines of inquiry. He talked
well, too, inspired by his attentive audience.</p>
<p>Berrie&#8217;s eyes, wide and eager, were fixed upon
him unwaveringly. He felt her wonder, her
admiration, and was inspired to do his best.
Something in her absorbed attention led him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
speak of things so personal that he wondered at
himself for uttering them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been dilettante all my life,&#8221; was one of
his confessions. &#8220;I&#8217;ve traveled; I&#8217;ve studied
in a tepid sort of fashion; I went through college
without any idea of doing anything with what
I got; I had a sort of pride in keeping up with
my fellows; and I had no idea of preparing for
any work in the world. Then came my breakdown,
and my doctor ordered me out here. I
came intending to fish and loaf around, but I
can&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;ve got to do something or go
back home. I expected to have a chum of mine
with me, but his father was injured in an automobile
accident, so he went into the office to
help out.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he talked the girl discovered new graces,
new allurements in him. His smile, so subtly
self-derisive, and his voice so flexible and so
quietly eloquent, completed her subjugation.
She had no further care concerning Clifford&mdash;indeed,
she had forgotten him&mdash;for the time at
least. The other part of her&mdash;the highly civilized
latent power drawn from her mother&mdash;was
in action. She lost her air of command,
her sense of chieftainship, and sat humbly at the
feet of this shining visitor from the East.</p>
<p>At last Mrs. McFarlane rose, and Berea, reluctantly,
like a child loath to miss a fairy story,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
held out her hand to say good night, and the
young man saw on her face that look of adoration
which marks the birth of sudden love; but his
voice was frank and his glance kindly as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I&#8217;ve done all the talking when I wanted
you to tell <i>me</i> all sorts of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, you can; and, besides, I want you
to intercede for me with your father and get
me into the Service. But we&#8217;ll talk about that
to-morrow. Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the women left the room Norcross said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I really am in earnest about entering the
Forest Service. Landon filled me with enthusiasm
about it. Never mind the pay. I&#8217;m not
in immediate need of money; but I do need an
interest in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane stared at him with kindly perplexity.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what you can
do, but I&#8217;ll work you in somehow. You ought to
work under a man like Settle, one that could put
you through a training in the rudiments of the
game. I&#8217;ll see what can be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for that half promise,&#8221; said Wayland,
and he went to his bed happier than at any
moment since leaving home.</p>
<p>Berrie, on her part, did not analyze her feeling
for Wayland, she only knew that he was as
different from the men she knew as a hawk from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
a sage-hen, and that he appealed to her in a
higher way than any other had done. His talk
filled her with visions of great cities, and with
thoughts of books, for though she was profoundly
loyal to her mountain valley, she held other, more
secret admirations. She was, in fact, compounded
of two opposing tendencies. Her quiet little
mother longing&mdash;in secret&mdash;for the placid, refined
life of her native Kentucky town, had
dowered her daughter with some part of her
desire. She had always hated the slovenly,
wasteful, and purposeless life of the cattle-rancher,
and though she still patiently bore with
her husband&#8217;s shortcomings, she covertly hoped
that Berea might find some other and more
civilized lover than Clifford Belden. She understood
her daughter too well to attempt to dictate
her action; she merely said to her, as they
were alone for a few moments: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder
your father is interested in Mr. Norcross, he&#8217;s
very intelligent&mdash;and very considerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too considerate,&#8221; said Berrie, shortly; &#8220;he
makes other men seem like bears or pigs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane said no more, but she knew
that Cliff was, for the time, among the bears.</p>

<h2>V</h2>
<h3>THE GOLDEN PATHWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>Young Norcross soon became vitally engaged
with the problems which confronted
McFarlane, and his possible enrolment as a guard
filled him with a sense of proprietorship in the
forest, which made him quite content with Bear
Tooth. He set to work at once to acquire a
better knowledge of the extent and boundaries
of the reservation. It was, indeed, a noble possession.
Containing nearly eight hundred thousand
acres of woodland, and reaching to the summits
of the snow-lined peaks to the east, south,
and west, it appealed to him with silent majesty.
It drew upon his patriotism. Remembering how
the timber of his own state had been slashed and
burned, he began to feel a sense of personal responsibility.
He had but to ride into it a few
miles in order to appreciate in some degree its
grandeur, considered merely as the source of a
hundred swift streams, whose waters enriched
the valleys lying below.</p>
<p>He bought a horse of his own&mdash;although Berrie
insisted upon his retaining Pete&mdash;and sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
for a saddle of the army type, and from sheer
desire to keep entirely clear of the cowboy equipment
procured puttees like those worn by cavalry
officers, and when he presented himself completely
uniformed, he looked not unlike a slender,
young lieutenant of the cavalry on field duty, and
in Berrie&#8217;s eyes was wondrous alluring.</p>
<p>He took quarters at the hotel, but spent a larger
part of each day in Berrie&#8217;s company&mdash;a fact
which was duly reported to Clifford Belden.
Hardly a day passed without his taking at least
one meal at the Supervisor&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>As he met the rangers one by one, he perceived
by their outfits, as well as by their speech, that
they were sharply divided upon old lines and
new. The experts, the men of college training,
were quite ready to be known as Uncle Sam&#8217;s
men. They held a pride in their duties, a respect
for their superiors, and an understanding of
the governmental policy which gave them dignity
and a quiet authority. They were less
policemen than trusted agents of a federal department.
Nevertheless, there was much to admire
in the older men, who possessed a self-reliance,
a knowledge of nature, and a certain
rough grace which made them interesting companions,
and rendered them effective teachers of
camping and trailing, and while they were
secretly a little contemptuous of the &#8220;schoolboys&#8221;;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
they were all quite ready to ask for expert
aid when knotty problems arose. It was no
longer a question of grazing, it was a question of
lumbering and reforestration.</p>
<p>Nash, who took an almost brotherly interest
in his apprentice, warningly said: &#8220;You want to
go well clothed and well shod. You&#8217;ll have to
meet all kinds of weather. Every man in the
service, I don&#8217;t care what his technical job is,
should be schooled in taking care of himself in
the forest and on the trail. I often meet surveyors
and civil engineers&mdash;experts&mdash;who are
helpless as children in camp, and when I want
them to go into the hills and do field work, they
are almost useless. The old-style ranger has his
virtues. Settle is just the kind of instructor
you young fellows need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie also had keen eyes for his outfit and his
training, and under her direction he learned to
pack a horse, set a tent, build a fire in the rain,
and other duties.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to remember that you carry your
bed and board with you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and you
must be prepared to camp anywhere and at
any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s skill in these particulars was marvelous
to him, and added to the admiration he already
felt for her. Her hand was as deft, as
sure, as the best of them, and her knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
of cayuse psychology more profound than any
of the men excepting her father.</p>
<p>One day, toward the end of his second week in
the village, the Supervisor said: &#8220;Well, now, if
you&#8217;re ready to experiment I&#8217;ll send you over to
Settle, the ranger, on the Horseshoe. He&#8217;s a little
lame on his pen-hand side, and you may be
able to help him out. Maybe I&#8217;ll ride over there
with you. I want to line out some timber sales
on the west side of Ptarmigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>This commission delighted Norcross greatly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m ready, sir, this moment,&#8221; he answered,
saluting soldier-wise.</p>
<p>That night, as he sat in the saddle-littered,
boot-haunted front room of Nash&#8217;s little shack,
his host said, quaintly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think you are inheriting
a soft snap, son. The ranger&#8217;s job was
a man&#8217;s job in the old days when it was a mere
matter of patrolling; but it&#8217;s worse and more of
it to-day. A ranger must be ready and willing
to build bridges, fight fire, scale logs, chop a hole
through a windfall, use a pick in a ditch, build
his own house, cook, launder, and do any other
old trick that comes along. But you&#8217;ll know
more about all this at the end of ten days than
I can tell you in a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m eager for duty,&#8221; replied Wayland.</p>
<p>The next morning, as he rode down to the office
to meet the Supervisor, he was surprised and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
delighted to find Berea there. &#8220;I&#8217;m riding, too,&#8221;
she announced, delightedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been
over that new trail, and father has agreed to let
me go along.&#8221; Then she added, earnestly: &#8220;I
think it&#8217;s fine you&#8217;re going in for the Service; but
it&#8217;s hard work, and you must be careful till you&#8217;re
hardened to it. It&#8217;s a long way to a doctor from
Settle&#8217;s station.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was annoyed as well as touched by her
warning, for it proclaimed that he was still far
from looking the brave forester he felt himself
to be. He replied: &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to try anything
wild, but I do intend to master the trailer&#8217;s
craft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you how to camp, if you&#8217;ll let me,&#8221;
she continued. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been on lots of surveys
with father, and I always take my share of the
work. I threw that hitch alone.&#8221; She nodded
toward the pack-horse, whose neat load gave
evidence of her skill. &#8220;I told father this was
to be a real camping expedition, and as the
grouse season is on we&#8217;ll live on the country.
Can you fish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about that,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Good thing
you didn&#8217;t ask me if I could <i>catch</i> fish?&#8221; He was
recovering his spirits. &#8220;It will be great fun to
have you as instructor in camp science. I seem
to be in for all kinds of good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both grew uneasy as time passed, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
fear something or some one would intervene to
prevent this trip, which grew in interest each
moment; but at last the Supervisor came out
and mounted his horse, the pack-ponies fell in
behind, Berrie followed, and the student of woodcraft
brought up to rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it won&#8217;t rain,&#8221; the girl called back at
him, &#8220;at least not till we get over the divide.
It&#8217;s a fine ride up the hill, and the foliage is at
its best.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to him the most glorious morning
of his life. A few large white clouds were drifting
like snow-laden war-vessels from west to
east, silent and solemn, and on the highest peaks
a gray vapor was lightly clinging. The near-by
hills, still transcendently beautiful with the flaming
gold of the aspen, burned against the dark
green of the farther forest, and far beyond the
deep purple of the shadowed slopes rose to smoky
blue and tawny yellow. It was a season, an
hour, to create raptures in a poet, so radiant, so
wide-reaching, so tumultuous was the landscape.
Nothing sad, nothing discouraging, showed itself.
The wind was brisk, the air cool and
clear, and jewel-like small, frost-painted vines
and ripened shrubberies blazed upward from the
ground. As he rode the youth silently repeated:
&#8220;Beautiful! Beautiful!&#8221;</p>
<p>For several miles they rode upward through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
golden forests of aspens. On either hand rose
thick walls of snow-white boles, and in the
mystic glow of their gilded leaves the face of the
girl shone with unearthly beauty. It was as if
the very air had become auriferous. Magic coins
dangled from the branches. Filmy shadows fell
over her hair and down her strong young arms
like priceless lace. Gold, gold! Everywhere
gold, gold and fire!</p>
<p>Twice she stopped to gaze into Wayland&#8217;s
face to say, with hushed intensity: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it
wonderful! Don&#8217;t you wish it would last forever?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words were poor, ineffectual; but her look,
her breathless voice made up for their lack of
originality. Once she said: &#8220;I never saw it so
lovely before; it is an enchanted land!&#8221; with no
suspicion that the larger part of her ecstasy
arose from the presence of her young and sympathetic
companion. He, too, responded to the
beauty of the day, of the golden forest as one
who had taken new hold on life after long illness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Supervisor was calmly leading
the way upward, vaguely conscious of the magical
air and mystic landscape in which his young
folk floated as if on wings, thinking busily of the
improvements which were still necessary in the
trail, and weighing with care the clouds which
still lingered upon the tallest summits, as if debating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
whether to go or to stay. He had never
been an imaginative soul, and now that age had
somewhat dimmed his eyes and blunted his senses
he was placidly content with his path. The
rapture of the lover, the song of the poet, had
long since abandoned his heart. And yet he was
not completely oblivious. To him it was a nice
day, but a &#8220;weather breeder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I shall ever ride through this
mountain world as unmoved as he seems to be?&#8221;
Norcross asked himself, after some jarring prosaic
remark from his chief. &#8220;I am glad Berrie
responds to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last they left these lower, wondrous forest
aisles and entered the unbroken cloak of firs
whose dark and silent deeps had a stern beauty
all their own; but the young people looked
back upon the glowing world below with wistful
hearts. Back and forth across a long, down-sweeping
ridge they wove their toilsome way
toward the clouds, which grew each hour more
formidable, awesome with their weight, ponderous
as continents in their majesty of movement.
The horses began to labor with roaring breath,
and Wayland, dismounting to lighten his pony&#8217;s
burden, was dismayed to discover how thin the
air had become. Even to walk unburdened gave
him a smothering pain in his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better stay on,&#8221; called the girl. &#8220;My rule
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
is to ride the hill going up and walk it going
down. Down hill is harder on a horse than
going up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless he persisted in clambering up
some of the steepest parts of the trail, and was
increasingly dismayed by the endless upward
reaches of the foot-hills. A dozen times he
thought, &#8220;We must be nearly at the top,&#8221; and
then other and far higher ridges suddenly developed.
Occasionally the Supervisor was forced
to unsling an ax and chop his way through a
fallen tree, and each time the student hurried to
the spot, ready to aid, but was quite useless. He
admired the ease and skill with which the older
man put his shining blade through the largest
bole, and wondered if he could ever learn to do
as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the first essentials of a ranger&#8217;s training
is to learn to swing an ax,&#8221; remarked McFarlane,
&#8220;and you never want to be without a real
tool. <i>I</i> won&#8217;t stand for a hatchet ranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie called attention to the marks on the
trees. &#8220;This is the government sign&mdash;a long
blaze with two notches above it. You can trust
these trails; they lead somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you ride a trail study how to improve it,&#8221;
added the Supervisor, sheathing his ax. &#8220;They
can all be improved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland was sure of this a few steps farther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
on, when the Supervisor&#8217;s horse went down in
a small bog-hole, and Berrie&#8217;s pony escaped only
by the most desperate plunging. The girl
laughed, but Wayland was appalled and stood
transfixed watching McFarlane as he calmly extricated
himself from the saddle of the fallen
horse and chirped for him to rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You act as if this were a regular part of the
journey,&#8221; Wayland said to Berrie.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the day&#8217;s work,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;but
I despise a bog worse than anything else on the
trail. I&#8217;ll show you how to go round this one.&#8221;
Thereupon she slid from her horse and came tiptoeing
back along the edge of the mud-hole.</p>
<p>McFarlane cut a stake and plunged it vertically
in the mud. &#8220;That means &#8216;no bottom,&#8217;&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;We must cut a new trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland was dismounting when Berrie said:
&#8220;Stay on. Now put your horse right through
where those rocks are. It&#8217;s hard bottom there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt like a child; but he did as she bid, and
so came safely through, while McFarlane set to
work to blaze a new route which should avoid
the slough which was already a bottomless horror
to the city man.</p>
<p>This mishap delayed them nearly half an hour,
and the air grew dark and chill as they stood
there, and the amateur ranger began to understand
how serious a lone night journey might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
sometimes be. &#8220;What would I do if when riding
in the dark my horse should go down like that
and pin me in the mud?&#8221; he asked himself.
&#8220;Eternal watchfulness is certainly one of the
forester&#8217;s first principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sky was overshadowed now, and a thin
drizzle of rain filled the air. The novice hastened
to throw his raincoat over his shoulders; but
McFarlane rode steadily on, clad only in his shirtsleeves,
unmindful of the wet. Berrie, however,
approved Wayland&#8217;s caution. &#8220;That&#8217;s right;
keep dry,&#8221; she called back. &#8220;Don&#8217;t pay attention
to father, he&#8217;d rather get soaked any day
than unroll his slicker. You mustn&#8217;t take him
for model yet awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>He no longer resented her sweet solicitude,
although he considered himself unentitled to it,
and he rejoiced under the shelter of his fine new
coat. He began to perceive that one could be
defended against a storm.</p>
<p>After passing two depressing marshes, they
came to a hillside so steep, so slippery, so dark,
so forbidding, that one of the pack-horses balked,
shook his head, and reared furiously, as if to say
&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, and I won&#8217;t try.&#8221; And Wayland
sympathized with him. The forest was gloomy
and cold, and apparently endless.</p>
<p>After coaxing him for a time with admirable
gentleness, the Supervisor, at Berrie&#8217;s suggestion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
shifted part of the load to her own saddle-horse,
and they went on.</p>
<p>Wayland, though incapable of comment&mdash;so
great was the demand upon his lungs&mdash;was not
too tired to admire the power and resolution of
the girl, who seemed not to suffer any special
inconvenience from the rarefied air. The dryness
of his open mouth, the throbbing of his
troubled pulse, the roaring of his breath, brought
to him with increasing dismay the fact that he
had overlooked another phase of the ranger&#8217;s
job. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t chop a hole through one of these
windfalls in a week,&#8221; he admitted, as McFarlane&#8217;s
blade again liberated them from a fallen
tree. &#8220;To do office work at six thousand feet
is quite different from swinging an ax up here at
timber-line,&#8221; he said to the girl. &#8220;I guess my
chest is too narrow for high altitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll get used to it,&#8221; she replied, cheerily.
&#8220;I always feel it a little at first; but I really think
it&#8217;s good for a body, kind o&#8217; stretches the lungs.&#8221;
Nevertheless, she eyed him with furtive anxiety.</p>
<p>He was beginning to be hungry also&mdash;he had
eaten a very early breakfast&mdash;and he fell to
wondering just where and when they were to
camp; but he endured in silence. &#8220;So long as
Berrie makes no complaint my mouth is shut,&#8221;
he told himself. &#8220;Surely I can stand it if she
can.&#8221; And so struggled on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Up and up the pathway looped, crossing minute
little boggy meadows, on whose bottomless
ooze the grass shook like a blanket, descending
steep ravines and climbing back to dark and
muddy slopes. The forest was dripping, green,
and silent now, a mysterious menacing jungle.
All the warmth and magic of the golden forest
below was lost as though it belonged to another
and sunnier world. Nothing could be seen of
the high, snow-flecked peaks which had allured
them from the valley. All about them drifted
the clouds, and yet through the mist the flushed
face of the girl glowed like a dew-wet rose, and
the imperturbable Supervisor jogged his remorseless,
unhesitating way toward the dense,
ascending night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not riding this pass alone,&#8221;
Wayland said, as they paused again for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; she answered; but her thought was
not his. She was happy at the prospect of teaching
him how to camp.</p>
<p>At last they reached the ragged edge of timber-line,
and there, rolling away under the mist, lay
the bare, grassy, upward-climbing, naked neck
of the great peak. The wind had grown keener
moment by moment, and when they left the
storm-twisted pines below, its breath had a
wintry nip. The rain had ceased to fall, but
the clouds still hung densely to the loftiest summits.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
It was a sinister yet beautiful world&mdash;a
world as silent as a dream, and through the
short, thick grass the slender trail ran like a timid
serpent. The hour seemed to have neither daytime
nor season. All was obscure, mysterious,
engulfing, and hostile. Had he been alone the
youth would have been appalled by the prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re on the divide,&#8221; called Berea; and
as she spoke they seemed to enter upon a boundless
Alpine plain of velvet-russet grass. &#8220;This
is the Bear Tooth plateau.&#8221; Low monuments
of loose rock stood on small ledges, as though to
mark the course, and in the hollows dark ponds
of icy water lay, half surrounded by masses of
compact snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a stormy place in winter,&#8221; McFarlane
explained. &#8220;These piles of stone are mighty
valuable in a blizzard. I&#8217;ve crossed this divide
in August in snow so thick I could not see a
rod.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later they began to descend.
Wind-twisted, storm-bleached dwarf pines were
first to show, then the firs, then the blue-green
spruces, and then the sheltering deeps of the undespoiled
forest opened, and the roar of a splendid
stream was heard; but still the Supervisor
kept his resolute way, making no promises as to
dinner, though his daughter called: &#8220;We&#8217;d better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
go into camp at Beaver Lake. I hope you&#8217;re not
starved,&#8221; she called to Wayland.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am,&#8221; he replied, so frankly that she
never knew how faint he really was. His knees
were trembling with weakness, and he stumbled
dangerously as he trod the loose rocks in the
path.</p>
<p>They were all afoot now descending swiftly,
and the horses ramped down the trail with expectant
haste, so that in less than an hour from
timber-line they were back into the sunshine of
the lower valley, and at three o&#8217;clock or thereabouts
they came out upon the bank of an
exquisite lake, and with a cheery shout McFarlane
called out: &#8220;Here we are, out of the wilderness!&#8221;
Then to Wayland: &#8220;Well, boy, how did
you stand it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just middling,&#8221; replied Wayland, reticent
from weariness and with joy of their camping-place.
The lake, dark as topaz and smooth as
steel, lay in a frame of golden willows&mdash;as a
jewel is filigreed with gold&mdash;and above it the
cliffs rose three thousand feet in sheer majesty,
their upper slopes glowing with autumnal grasses.
A swift stream roared down a low ledge and fell
into the pond near their feet. Grassy, pine-shadowed
knolls afforded pasture for the horses,
and two giant firs, at the edge of a little glade,
made a natural shelter for their tent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>With businesslike certitude Berrie unsaddled
her horse, turned him loose, and lent a skilful hand
at removing the panniers from the pack-animals,
while Wayland, willing but a little uncertain,
stood awkwardly about. Under her instruction
he collected dead branches of a standing fir, and
from these and a few cones kindled a blaze, while
the Supervisor hobbled the horses and set the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the work of a forester were all like this it
wouldn&#8217;t be so bad,&#8221; he remarked, wanly. &#8220;I
think I know several fellows who would be glad
to do it without a cent of pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you get to heaving a pick,&#8221; she retorted,
&#8220;or scaling lumber in a rain, or building
a corduroy bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to think of anything so dreadful.
I want to enjoy this moment. I never was
hungrier or happier in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do ye good,&#8221; interjected McFarlane, who
had paused to straighten up the coffee-pot.
&#8220;Most people don&#8217;t know what hunger means.
There&#8217;s nothing finer in the world than good old-fashioned
hunger, provided you&#8217;ve got something
to throw into yourself when you come into camp.
This is a great place for fish. I think I&#8217;ll see if
I can&#8217;t jerk a few out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait till night,&#8221; said his daughter.
&#8220;Mr. Norcross is starving, and so am I. Plain
bacon will do me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>The coffee came to a boil, the skillet gave off
a wondrous savor, and when the corn and beans
began to sizzle, the trailers sat down to their
feast in hearty content, with one of the panniers
for a table, and the fir-tree for roof. &#8220;This is
one of the most perfectly appointed dining-rooms
in the world,&#8221; exclaimed the alien.</p>
<p>The girl met his look with a tender smile.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it, for perhaps we&#8217;ll stay a
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks stormy,&#8221; the Supervisor announced,
after a glance at the crests. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see a
soaking rain&mdash;it would end all our worry about
fires. The country&#8217;s very dry on this side the
range, and your duty for the present will be to
help Tony patrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he talked on, telling the youth how to
beat out a small blaze and how to head off a
large one, Wayland listened, but heard his instructions
only as he sensed the brook, as an accompaniment
to Berea&#8217;s voice, for as she busied
herself clearing away the dishes and putting the
camp to rights, she sang.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to have the tent,&#8221; said her father,
&#8220;and we two huskies will sleep under the shade
of this big fir. If you&#8217;re ever caught out,&#8221; he
remarked to Wayland, &#8220;hunt for one of these
balsam firs; there&#8217;s always a dry spot under
them. See here!&#8221; And he showed him the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
sheltered circle beneath the tree. &#8220;You can always
get twigs for kindling from their inner
branches,&#8221; he added, &#8220;or you can hew into one
of these dead trees and get some pitchy splinters.
There&#8217;s material for everything you want if you
know where to find it. Shelter, food, fire are all
here for us as they were for the Indians. A
ranger who needs a roof all the time is not worth
his bacon.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, one by one, the principles of camping were
taught by the kindly old rancher; but the hints
which the girl gave were quite as valuable, for
Wayland was eager to show her that he could be,
and intended to be, a forester of the first class
or perish in the attempt.</p>
<p>McFarlane went farther and talked freely of
the forest and what it meant to the government.
&#8220;We&#8217;re all green at the work,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we
old chaps are only holding the fort against the
thieves till you youngsters learn how to make
the best use of the domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that it takes more than technical
training to enable a man to be Supervisor of a
forest,&#8221; conceded Wayland.</p>
<p>McFarlane was pleased with this remark.
&#8220;That&#8217;s true, too. It&#8217;s a big responsibility.
When I first came on, it was mainly patrolling;
but now, with a half dozen sawmills, and these
&#8216;June Eleventh Homesteads,&#8217; and the new ways
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
of marking timber, and the grazing and free-use
permits, the office work has doubled. And this
is only the beginning. Wait till Colorado has
two millions of people, and all these lower valleys
are clamoring for water. Then you&#8217;ll see a new
party spring up&mdash;right here in our state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie was glowing with happiness. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
stay here till the end of the week,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to camp on this lake, and
now I&#8217;m here I want time to enjoy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay a day or two,&#8221; said her father;
&#8220;but I must get over to that ditch survey which
is being made at the head of Poplar, and then
Moore is coming over to look at some timber
on Porcupine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young people cut willow rods and went
angling at the outlet of the lake with prodigious
success. The water rippled with trout, and in
half an hour they had all they could use for supper
and breakfast, and, behold, even as they were
returning with their spoil they met a covey of
grouse strolling leisurely down to the lake&#8217;s
edge. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a wonderful place!&#8221; exclaimed
the happy girl. &#8220;I wish we could stay a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like being on the Swiss Family Robinson&#8217;s
Island. I never was more content,&#8221; he
said, fervently. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind staying here
all winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;The snow falls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
four feet deep up here. It&#8217;s likely there&#8217;s snow
on the divide this minute, and camping in the
snow isn&#8217;t so funny. Some people got snowed
in over at Deep Lake last year and nearly all their
horses starved before they could get them out.
This is a fierce old place in winter-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine it,&#8221; he said, indicating the
glowing amphitheater which inclosed the lake.
&#8220;See how warmly the sun falls into that high
basin! It&#8217;s all as beautiful as the Tyrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air at the moment was golden October, and
the dark clouds which lay to the east seemed the
wings of a departing rather than an approaching
storm; and even as they looked, a rainbow sprang
into being, arching the lake as if in assurance of
peace and plenty, and the young people, as they
turned to face it, stood so close together that
each felt the glow of the other&#8217;s shoulder. The
beauty of the scene seemed to bring them together
in body as in spirit, and they fell silent.</p>
<p>McFarlane seemed quite unconscious of any
necromancy at work upon his daughter. He
smoked his pipe, made notes in his field-book,
directing an occasional remark toward his apprentice,
enjoying in his tranquil, middle-age
way the beauty and serenity of the hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kind of thing that makes up for
a hard day&#8217;s ride,&#8221; he said, jocosely.</p>
<p>As the sunset came on, the young people again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
loitered down to the water&#8217;s edge, and there,
seated side by side, on a rocky knoll, watched
the phantom gold lift from the willows and climb
slowly to the cliffs above, while the water deepened
in shadow, and busy muskrats marked its
glossy surface with long silvery lines. Mischievous
camp-birds peered at the couple from
the branches of the pines uttering satirical comment,
while squirrels, frankly insolent, dropped
cones upon their heads and barked in saucy glee.</p>
<p>Wayland forgot all the outside world, forgot
that he was studying to be a forest ranger, and
was alive only to the fact that in this most bewitching
place, in this most entrancing hour, he
had the companionship of a girl whose eyes
sought his with every new phase of the silent
and wonderful scene which shifted swiftly before
their eyes like a noiseless yet prodigious drama.
The blood in his thin body warmed. He forgot
his fatigue, his weakness. He was the poet and
the forest lover, and this the heart of the range.</p>
<p>Lightly the golden glory rose till only the
highest peaks retained its flame; then it leapt to
the clouds behind the peaks, and gorgeously lit
their somber sulphurous masses. The edges of
the pool grew black as night; the voice of the
stream grew stern; and a cold wind began to
fall from the heights, sliding like an invisible but
palpable icy cataract.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>At last the girl rose. &#8220;It is getting dark. I
must go back and get supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need any supper,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father does, and you&#8217;ll be hungry before
morning,&#8221; she retorted, with sure knowledge of
men.</p>
<p>He turned from the scene reluctantly; but
once at the camp-fire cheerfully gave his best
efforts to the work in hand, seconding Berrie&#8217;s
skill as best he could.</p>
<p>The trout, deliciously crisp, and some potatoes
and batter-cakes made a meal that tempted even
his faint appetite, and when the dishes were
washed and the towels hung out to dry, deep
night possessed even the high summit of stately
Ptarmigan.</p>
<p>McFarlane then said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll just take a little
turn to see that the horses are all right, and then
I think we&#8217;d better close in for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they were alone in the light of the fire,
Wayland turned to Berrie: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re
here. It must be awesome to camp alone in a
wilderness; and yet, I suppose, I must learn to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the ranger often has to camp alone, ride
alone, and work alone for weeks at a time,&#8221; she
assured him. &#8220;A good trailer don&#8217;t mind a night
trip any more than he does a day trip, or if he
does he never admits it. Rain, snow, darkness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
is all the same to him. Most of the boys are
fifteen to forty miles from the post-office.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled ruefully. &#8220;I begin to have new
doubts about this ranger business. It&#8217;s a little
more vigorous than I thought it was. Suppose
a fellow breaks a leg on one of those high trails?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He mustn&#8217;t!&#8221; she hastened to say. &#8220;He
can&#8217;t afford really to take reckless chances; but
then father won&#8217;t expect as much of you as he
does of the old-stagers. You&#8217;ll have plenty of
time to get used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be like the old man&#8217;s cow and the
green shavings, just as I&#8217;m getting used to it
I&#8217;ll die.&#8221;</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t laugh at this. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be
rash; don&#8217;t jump into any hard jobs for the
present; let the other fellow do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not very manly. If I go into the
work I ought to be able to take my share of any
task that turns up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go slow,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;Wait
till you get hardened to it. You need something
over your shoulders now,&#8221; she added; and rose
and laid a blanket over him. &#8220;You&#8217;re tired;
you&#8217;ll take a chill if you&#8217;re not careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very considerate,&#8221; he said, looking
up at her gratefully. &#8220;But it makes me feel
like a child to think I need such care. If honestly
trying, if going up against these hills and winds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
with Spartan courage will do me good, I&#8217;m for it.
I&#8217;m resolved to show to you and your good
father that I can learn to ride and pack and cut
trail, and do all the rest of it&mdash;there&#8217;s some honor
in qualifying as a forester, and I&#8217;m going to do
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there isn&#8217;t much in it for you. The
pay, even of a full ranger, isn&#8217;t much, after you
count out his outlay for horses and saddles and
their feed, and his own feed. It don&#8217;t leave
so very much of his ninety dollars a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking of that,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;If
you had once seen a doctor shake his head over
you, as I have, you&#8217;d think just being here in this
glorious spot, as I am to-night, would be compensation
enough. It&#8217;s a joy to be in the world,
and a delight to have you for my teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was silent under the pleasure of his praise,
and he went on: &#8220;I <i>know</i> I&#8217;m better, and, I&#8217;m
perfectly certain I can regain my strength. The
very odor of these pines and the power of these
winds will bring it back to me. See me now, and
think how I looked when I came here six weeks
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with fond agreement.
&#8220;You <i>are</i> better. When I saw you first I surely
thought you were&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you thought&mdash;and forget it,
<i>please</i>! Think of me as one who has touched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
mother earth again and is on the way to being
made a giant. You can&#8217;t imagine how marvelous,
how life-giving all this is to me. It is poetry,
it is prophecy, it is fulfilment. I am fully alive
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane, upon his return, gave some advice
relating to the care of horses. &#8220;All this stock
which is accustomed to a barn or a pasture will
quit you,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Watch your broncos.
Put them on the outward side of your camp when
you bed down, and pitch your tent near the trail,
then you will hear the brutes if they start back.
Some men tie their stock all up; but I usually
picket my saddle-horse and hobble the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a delightful hour for schooling, and Wayland
would have been content to sit there till
morning listening; but the air bit, and at last
the Supervisor asked: &#8220;Have you made your
bed? If you have, turn in. I shall get you out
early to-morrow.&#8221; As he saw the bed, he added:
&#8220;I see you&#8217;ve laid out a bed of boughs. That
shows how Eastern you are. We don&#8217;t do that
out here. It&#8217;s too cold in this climate, and it&#8217;s
too much work. You want to hug the ground&mdash;if
it&#8217;s dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The weary youth went to his couch with a
sense of timorous elation, for he had never before
slept beneath the open sky. Over him the giant
fir&mdash;tall as a steeple&mdash;dropped protecting shadow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
and looking up he could see the firelight
flickering on the wide-spread branches. His bed
seemed to promise all the dreams and restful
drowse which the books on outdoor life had described,
and close by in her tiny little canvas
house he could hear the girl in low-voiced conversation
with her sire. All conditions seemed
right for slumber, and yet slumber refused to
come!</p>
<p>After the Supervisor had rolled himself in the
blanket, long after all sounds had ceased in the
tent, there still remained for the youth a score of
manifold excitations to wakefulness. Down on
the lake the muskrats and beavers were at their
work. Nocturnal birds uttered uncanny, disturbing
cries. Some animal with stealthy crackling
tread was ranging the hillside, and the roar of
the little fall, so far from lulling him to sleep&mdash;as
he had imagined it would&mdash;stimulated his
imagination till he could discern in it the beat
of scurrying wings and the patter of pernicious
padded feet. &#8220;If I am appalled by the wilderness
now, what would it seem to me were I
alone!&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>Then, too, his bed of boughs discovered unforeseen
humps and knobs, and by the time he
had adjusted himself to their discomfort, it became
evident that his blankets were both too
thin and too short. And the gelid air sweeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
down from the high places submerged him as if
with a flood of icy water. In vain he turned and
twisted within his robes. No sooner were his
shoulders covered and comfortable than his hip-bones
began to ache. Later on the blood of his
feet congealed, and in the effort to wrap them
more closely, he uncovered his neck and shoulders.
The frost became a wolf, the night an oppressor.
&#8220;I must have a different outfit,&#8221; he decided.
And then thinking that this was but early autumn,
he added: &#8220;What will it be a month later?&#8221;
He began to doubt his ability to measure up to
the heroic standard of a forest patrol.</p>
<p>The firelight flickered low, and a prowling animal
daringly sniffed about the camp, pawing at
the castaway fragments of the evening meal.
The youth was rigid with fear. &#8220;Is it a bear?
Shall I call the Supervisor?&#8221; he asked himself.</p>
<p>He felt sadly unprotected, and wished McFarlane
nearer at hand. &#8220;It may be a lion, but
probably it is only a coyote, or a porcupine,&#8221; he
concluded, and lay still for what seemed like
hours waiting for the beast to gorge himself
and go away.</p>
<p>He longed for morning with intense desire,
and watched an amazingly luminous star which
hung above the eastern cliff, hoping to see it pale
and die in dawn light, but it did not; and the
wind bit even sharper. His legs ached almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
to the cramping-point, and his hip-bones protruded
like knots on a log. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I
had door-knobs on my hips,&#8221; he remarked, with
painful humor, and, looking down at his feet,
he saw that a thick rime was gathering on his
blanket. &#8220;This sleeping out at night isn&#8217;t what
the books crack it up to be,&#8221; he groaned again,
drawing his feet up to the middle of his bed
to warm them. &#8220;Shall I resign to-morrow?
No, I&#8217;ll stay with it; but I&#8217;ll have more clothing.
I&#8217;ll have blankets six inches thick. Heaps of
blankets&mdash;the fleecy kind&mdash;I&#8217;ll have an air-mattress.&#8221;
His mind luxuriated in these details
till he fell into an uneasy drowse.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>STORM-BOUND</h3>
</div>

<p>Wayland was awakened by the mellow
voice of his chief calling: &#8220;<i>All out! All out!
Daylight down the creek!</i>&#8221; Breathing a prayer of
thankfulness, the boy sat up and looked about
him. &#8220;The long night is over at last, and I am
alive!&#8221; he said, and congratulated himself.</p>
<p>He drew on his shoes and, stiff and shivering,
stood about in helpless misery, while McFarlane
kicked the scattered, charred logs together, and
fanned the embers into a blaze with his hat.
It was heartening to see the flames leap up,
flinging wide their gorgeous banners of heat and
light, and in their glow the tenderfoot ranger
rapidly recovered his courage, though his teeth
still chattered and the forest was dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you sleep?&#8221; asked the Supervisor.</p>
<p>&#8220;First rate&mdash;at least during the latter part
of the night,&#8221; Wayland briskly lied.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I was afraid that Adirondack
bed of yours might let the white wolf in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My blankets did seem a trifle thin,&#8221; confessed
Norcross.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t pay to sleep cold,&#8221; the Supervisor
went on. &#8220;A man wants to wake up refreshed,
not tired out with fighting the night wind and
frost. I always carry a good bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was instructive to see how quietly and
methodically the old mountaineer went about his
task of getting the breakfast. First he cut and
laid a couple of eight-inch logs on either side of
the fire, so that the wind drew through them
properly, then placing his dutch-oven cover on
the fire, he laid the bottom part where the flames
touched it. Next he filled his coffee-pot with
water, and set it on the coals. From his pannier
he took his dishes and the flour and salt and pepper,
arranging them all within reach, and at last
laid some slices of bacon in the skillet.</p>
<p>At this stage of the work a smothered cry,
half yawn, half complaint, came from the tent.
&#8220;Oh, hum! Is it morning?&#8221; inquired Berrie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning!&#8221; replied her father. &#8220;It&#8217;s going
toward noon. You get up or you&#8217;ll have no
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Wayland called: &#8220;Can I get you
anything, Miss Berrie? Would you like some
warm water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; interposed McFarlane, before
the girl could reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;To bathe in,&#8221; replied the youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;To bathe in! If a daughter of mine should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
ask for warm water to wash with I&#8217;d throw her
in the creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie chuckled. &#8220;Sometimes I think daddy
has no feeling for me. I reckon he thinks I&#8217;m
a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot water is debilitating, and very bad for
the complexion,&#8221; retorted her father. &#8220;Ice-cold
water is what you need. And if you don&#8217;t get
out o&#8217; there in five minutes I&#8217;ll dowse you with
a dipperful.&#8221;</p>
<p>This reminded Wayland that he had not yet
made his own toilet, and, seizing soap, towel,
and brushes, he hurried away down to the beach
where he came face to face with the dawn. The
splendor of it smote him full in the eyes. From
the waveless surface of the water a spectral mist
was rising, a light veil, through which the stupendous
cliffs loomed three thousand feet in
height, darkly shadowed, dim and far. The
willows along the western marge burned as if
dipped in liquid gold, and on the lofty crags the
sun&#8217;s coming created keen-edged shadows, violet
as ink. Truly this forestry business was not
so bad after all. It had its compensations.</p>
<p>Back at the camp-fire he found Berrie at work,
glowing, vigorous, laughing. Her comradeship
with her father was very charming, and at the
moment she was rallying him on his method of
bread-mixing. &#8220;You should rub the lard into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
the flour,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to get
your hands into it&mdash;after they are clean. You
can&#8217;t mix bread with a spoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sis, I made camp bread for twenty years
afore you were born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you lived to tell of it,&#8221; she retorted,
and took the pan away from him. &#8220;That&#8217;s
another thing <i>you</i> must learn,&#8221; she said to Wayland.
&#8220;You must know how to make bread.
You can&#8217;t expect to find bake-shops or ranchers
along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the heat of the fire, in the charm of the
girl&#8217;s presence, the young man forgot the discomforts
of the night, and as they sat at breakfast,
and the sun rising over the high summits
flooded them with warmth and good cheer, and
the frost melted like magic from the tent, the
experience had all the satisfying elements of a
picnic. It seemed that nothing remained to do;
but McFarlane said: &#8220;Well, now, you youngsters
wash up and pack whilst I reconnoiter the stock.&#8221;
And with his saddle and bridle on his shoulder
he went away down the trail.</p>
<p>Under Berrie&#8217;s direction Wayland worked
busily putting the camp equipment in proper
parcels, taking no special thought of time till
the tent was down and folded, the panniers filled
and closed, and the fire carefully covered. Then
the girl said: &#8220;I hope the horses haven&#8217;t been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
stampeded. There are bears in this valley, and
horses are afraid of bears. Father ought to have
been back before this. I hope they haven&#8217;t
quit us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I go and see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;ll bring &#8217;em&mdash;if they&#8217;re in the land of
the living. He picketed his saddle-horse, so
he&#8217;s not afoot. Nobody can teach him anything
about trailing horses, and, besides, you might
get lost. You&#8217;d better keep close to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Wayland put aside all responsibility.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can catch some more
fish,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>To this she agreed, and together they went
again to the outlet of the lake&mdash;where the trout
could be seen darting to and fro on the clear,
dark flood&mdash;and there cast their flies till they had
secured ten good-sized fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop now,&#8221; declared the girl. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe in being wasteful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more at the camp they prepared the fish
for the pan. The sun suddenly burned hot and
the lake was still as brass, but great, splendid,
leisurely, gleaming clouds were sailing in from the
west, all centering about Chief Audobon, and the
experienced girl looked often at the sky. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like the feel of the air. See that gray cloud
spreading out over the summits of the range,
that means something more than a shower. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
do hope daddy will overtake the horses before
they cross the divide. It&#8217;s going to pour up
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. We&#8217;ll stay right here and get dinner
for him. He&#8217;ll be hungry when he gets
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they were unpacking the panniers and getting
out the dishes, thunder broke from the high
crags above the lake, and the girl called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick! It&#8217;s going to rain! We must reset
the tent and get things under cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he was put to shame by the decision,
the skill, and the strength with which she
went about re-establishing the camp. She led,
he followed in every action. In ten minutes the
canvas was up, the beds rolled, the panniers protected,
the food stored safely; but they were none
too soon, for the thick gray veil of rain, which
had clothed the loftiest crags for half an hour,
swung out over the water&mdash;leaden-gray under
its folds&mdash;and with a roar which began in the
tall pines&mdash;a roar which deepened, hushed only
when the thunder crashed resoundingly from
crag to crest&mdash;the tempest fell upon the camp
and the world of sun and odorous pine vanished
almost instantly, and a dark, threatening, and
forbidding world took its place.</p>
<p>But the young people&mdash;huddled close together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
beneath the tent&mdash;would have enjoyed the change
had it not been for the thought of the Supervisor.
&#8220;I hope he took his slicker,&#8221; the girl said, between
the tearing, ripping flashes of the lightning.
&#8220;It&#8217;s raining hard up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How quickly it came. Who would have
thought it could rain like this after so beautiful
a morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It storms when it storms&mdash;in the mountains,&#8221;
she responded, with the sententious air of
her father. &#8220;You never can tell what the sky
is going to do up here. It is probably snowing
on the high divide. Looks now as though those
cayuses pulled out sometime in the night and
have hit the trail for home. That&#8217;s the trouble
with stall-fed stock. They&#8217;ll quit you any time
they feel cold and hungry. Here comes the hail!&#8221;
she shouted, as a sharper, more spiteful roar
sounded far away and approaching. &#8220;Now keep
from under!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will your father do?&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about him. He&#8217;s at home any
place there&#8217;s a tree. He&#8217;s probably under a balsam
somewhere, waiting for this ice to spill out.
The only point is, they may get over the divide,
and if they do it will be slippery coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time the thought that the Supervisor
might not be able to return entered Wayland&#8217;s
mind; but he said nothing of his fear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>The hail soon changed to snow, great, clinging,
drowsy, soft, slow-moving flakes, and with their
coming the roar died away and the forest became
as silent as a grave of bronze. Nothing moved,
save the thick-falling, feathery, frozen vapor,
and the world was again very beautiful and very
mysterious.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must keep the fire going,&#8221; warned the
girl. &#8220;It will be hard to start after this
soaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw upon the fire all of the wood which
lay near, and Berrie, taking the ax, went to the
big fir and began to chop off the dry branches
which hung beneath, working almost as effectively
as a man. Wayland insisted on taking a
turn with the tool; but his efforts were so awkward
that she laughed and took it away again.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take lessons in swinging an ax,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s part of the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gradually the storm lightened, the snow
changed back into rain, and finally to mist;
but up on the heights the clouds still rolled wildly,
and through their openings the white drifts
bleakly shone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the trip,&#8221; said Berrie. &#8220;You have
to take the weather as it comes on the trail.&#8221;
As the storm lessened she resumed the business
of cooking the midday meal, and at two o&#8217;clock
they were able to eat in comparative comfort,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
though the unmelted snow still covered the trees,
and water dripped from the branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it beautiful!&#8221; exclaimed Wayland, with
glowing boyish face. &#8220;The landscape is like a
Christmas card. In its way it&#8217;s quite as beautiful
as that golden forest we rode through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be so beautiful if you had to wallow
through ten miles of it,&#8221; she sagely responded.
&#8220;Daddy will be wet to the skin, for I found
he didn&#8217;t take his slicker. However, the sun may
be out before night. That&#8217;s the way the thing
goes in the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the youth, though the peaks were storm-hid,
the afternoon was joyous. Berrie was a
sweet companion. Under her supervision he
practised at chopping wood and took a hand at
cooking. At her suggestion he stripped the tarpaulin
from her father&#8217;s bed and stretched it
over a rope before the tent, thus providing a
commodious kitchen and dining-room. Under
this roof they sat and talked of everything except
what they should do if the father did not
return, and as they talked they grew to even
closer understanding.</p>
<p>Though quite unlearned of books, she had
something which was much more piquant than
anything which theaters and novels could give&mdash;she
possessed a marvelous understanding of the
natural world in which she lived. As the companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
of her father on many of his trips, she
had absorbed from him, as well as from the
forest, a thousand observations of plant and
animal life. Seemingly she had nothing of the
woman&#8217;s fear of the wilderness, she scarcely
acknowledged any awe of it. Of the bears, and
other predatory beasts, she spoke carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bears are harmless if you let &#8217;em alone,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and the mountain-lion is a great big bluff.
He won&#8217;t fight, you can&#8217;t make him fight; but
the mother lion will. She&#8217;s dangerous when she
has cubs&mdash;most animals are. I was out hunting
grouse one day with a little twenty-two rifle,
when all at once, as I looked up along a rocky
point I was crossing, I saw a mountain-lion looking
at me. First I thought I&#8217;d let drive at him;
but the chances were against my getting him
from there, so I climbed up above him&mdash;or where
I thought he was&mdash;and while I was looking for
him I happened to glance to my right, and there
he was about fifty feet away looking at me pleasant
as you please. Didn&#8217;t seem to be mad at
all&mdash;&#8217;peared like he was just wondering what I&#8217;d
do next. I jerked my gun into place, but he
faded away. I crawled around to get behind
him, and just when I reached the ledge on which
he had been standing a few minutes before, I
saw him just where I&#8217;d been. He had traded
places with me. I began to have that creepy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
feeling. He was so silent and so kind of pleasant-looking
I got leery of him. It just seemed like
as though I&#8217;d dreamed him. He didn&#8217;t seem real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland shuddered. &#8220;You foolish girl! Why
didn&#8217;t you run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. I began to figure then that this was
a mother lion, and that her cubs were close by,
and that she could just as well sneak up and drop
on me from above as not. So I got down and left
her alone. It was her popping up now here and
now there like a ghost that locoed me. I was sure
scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland did not enjoy this tale. &#8220;I never
heard of such folly. Did your father learn of
that adventure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I told him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he forbid your hunting any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed! Why should he? He just said
it probably was a lioness, and that it was just as
well to let her alone. He knows I&#8217;m no chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about your mother&mdash;does she approve
of such expeditions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mother worries more or less when I&#8217;m away;
but then she knows it don&#8217;t do any good. I&#8217;m
taking all kinds of chances every day, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had to admit that she was better able to
care for herself in the wilderness than most men&mdash;even
Western men&mdash;and though he had not
yet witnessed a display of her skill with a rifle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
he was ready to believe that she could shoot as
well as her sire. Nevertheless, he liked her better
when engaged in purely feminine duties, and
he led the talk back to subjects concerning which
her speech was less blunt and manlike.</p>
<p>He liked her when she was joking, for delicious
little curves of laughter played about her lips.
She became very amusing, as she told of her
&#8220;visits East,&#8221; and of her embarrassments in the
homes of city friends. &#8220;I just have to own up
that about all the schooling I&#8217;ve got is from the
magazines. Sometimes I wish I had pulled out
for town when I was about fourteen; but, you
see, I didn&#8217;t feel like leaving mother, and she
didn&#8217;t feel like letting me go&mdash;and so I just got
what I could at Bear Tooth.&#8221; She sprang up.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a patch of blue sky. Let&#8217;s go see if we
can&#8217;t get a grouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The snow had nearly all sunk into the ground
on their level; but it still lay deep on the heights
above, and the torn masses of vapor still clouded
the range. &#8220;Father has surely had to go over
the divide,&#8221; she said, as they walked down the
path along the lake shore. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be late getting
back, and a plate of hot chicken will seem
good to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they strolled along the edge of the
willows. &#8220;The grouse come down to feed about
this time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll put up a covey soon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>It seemed to him as though he were re-living
the experiences of his ancestors&mdash;the pioneers of
Michigan&mdash;as he walked this wilderness with this
intrepid huntress whose alert eyes took note of
every moving thing. She was delightfully unconscious
of self, of sex, of any doubt or fear.
A lovely Diana&mdash;strong and true and sweet.</p>
<p>Within a quarter of a mile they found their
birds, and she killed four with five shots. &#8220;This
is all we need,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t believe in
killing for the sake of killing. Rangers should
set good examples in way of game preservation.
They are deputy game-wardens in most states,
and good ones, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stopped for a time on a high bank above
the lake, while the sunset turned the storm-clouds
into mountains of brass and iron, with
sulphurous caves and molten glowing ledges.
This grandiose picture lasted but a few minutes,
and then the Western gates closed and all was
again gray and forbidding. &#8220;Open and shut is
a sign of wet,&#8221; quoted Berrie, cheerily.</p>
<p>The night rose formidably from the valley while
they ate their supper; but Berrie remained tranquil.
&#8220;Those horses probably went clean back
to the ranch. If they did, daddy can&#8217;t possibly
get back before eight o&#8217;clock, and he may not
get back till to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>THE WALK IN THE RAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Norcross, with his city training, was
acutely conscious of the delicacy of the
situation. In his sister&#8217;s circle a girl left alone
in this way with a man would have been very
seriously embarrassed; but it was evident that
Berrie took it all joyously, innocently. Their
being together was something which had happened
in the natural course of weather, a condition
for which they were in no way responsible.
Therefore she permitted herself to be frankly
happy in the charm of their enforced intimacy.</p>
<p>She had never known a youth of his quality.
He was so considerate, so refined, so quick of
understanding, and so swift to serve. He filled
her mind to the exclusion of unimportant matters
like the snow, which was beginning again; indeed,
her only anxiety concerned his health, and
as he toiled amid the falling flakes, intent upon
heaping up wood enough to last out the night,
she became solicitous.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be soaked,&#8221; she warningly cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stay out any more. Come to the fire.
I&#8217;ll bring in the wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something primeval, some strength he did not
know he possessed sustained him, and he toiled
on. &#8220;Suppose this snow keeps falling?&#8221; he retorted.
&#8220;The Supervisor will not be able to get
back to-night&mdash;perhaps not for a couple of
nights. We will need a lot of fuel.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not voice the fear of the storm which
filled his thought; but the girl understood it.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t be very cold,&#8221; she calmly replied. &#8220;It
never is during these early blizzards; and, besides,
all we need to do is to drop down the trail
ten miles and we&#8217;ll be entirely out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll feel safer with plenty of wood,&#8221; he argued;
but soon found it necessary to rest from his
labors. Coming in to camp, he seated himself
beside her on a roll of blankets, and so together
they tended the fire and watched the darkness
roll over the lake till the shining crystals seemed
to drop from a measureless black arch, soundless
and oppressive. The wind died away, and the
trees stood as if turned into bronze, moveless,
save when a small branch gave way and dropped
its rimy burden, or a squirrel leaped from one
top to another. Even the voice of the waterfall
seemed muffled and remote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a long way from home and mother,&#8221;
Wayland said, with a smile; &#8220;but&mdash;I like it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fun?&#8221; she responded. &#8220;In a way it&#8217;s
nicer on account of the storm. But you are not
dressed right; you should have waterproof boots.
You never can tell when you may be set afoot.
You should always go prepared for rain and
snow, and, above all, have an extra pair of thick
stockings. Your feet are soaked now, aren&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are; but your father told me to always
dry my boots on my feet, otherwise they&#8217;d shrink
out of shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, too; but you&#8217;d better take &#8217;em
off and wring out your socks or else put on dry
ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You insist on my playing the invalid,&#8221; he
complained, &#8220;and that makes me angry. When
I&#8217;ve been over here a month you&#8217;ll find me a
glutton for hardship. I shall be a bear, a grizzly,
fearful to contemplate. My roar will affright
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed like a child at his ferocity.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to change a whole lot,&#8221; she said,
and drew the blanket closer about his shoulders.
&#8220;Just now your job is to keep warm and dry.
I hope you won&#8217;t get lonesome over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to open a book or read a newspaper.
I&#8217;m not going to write to a single soul
except you. I&#8217;ll be obliged to report to you,
won&#8217;t I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the Supervisor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the next thing to it,&#8221; he quickly retorted.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been my board of health from
the very first. I should have fled for home long
ago had it not been for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell under his glance. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get
pretty tired of things over here. It&#8217;s one of the
lonesomest stations in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get lonesome for you; but not for the
East.&#8221; This remark, or rather the tone in which
it was uttered, brought another flush of consciousness
to the girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it now?&#8221; she asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. &#8220;Half after eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If father isn&#8217;t on this side of the divide now
he won&#8217;t try to cross. If he&#8217;s coming down the
slope he&#8217;ll be here in an hour, although that trail
is a tolerably tough proposition this minute. A
patch of dead timber on a dark night is sure a
nuisance, even to a good man. He may not
make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I fire my gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a signal to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>This amused her. &#8220;Daddy don&#8217;t need any
hint about direction&mdash;what he needs is a light
to see the twist of the trail through those fallen
logs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I rig up a torch and go to meet him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>She put her hand on his arm. &#8220;You stay
right here!&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t
follow that trail five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a very poor opinion of my skill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t; but I know how hard it is
to keep direction on a night like this and I don&#8217;t
want you wandering around in the timber.
Father can take care of himself. He&#8217;s probably
sitting under a big tree smoking his pipe before
his fire&mdash;or else he&#8217;s at home. He knows we&#8217;re
all right, and we are. We have wood and grub,
and plenty of blankets, and a roof over us. You
can make your bed under this fly,&#8221; she said, looking
up at the canvas. &#8220;It beats the old balsam
as a roof. You mustn&#8217;t sleep cold again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better sit up and keep the fire
going,&#8221; he replied, heroically. &#8220;There&#8217;s a big
log out there that I&#8217;m going to bring in to roll
up on the windward side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be cold and wet early in the morning,
and I don&#8217;t like to hunt kindling in the snow,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I always get everything ready the
night before. I wish you had a better bed. It
seems selfish of me to have the tent while you are
cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one&mdash;under her supervision&mdash;he made
preparations for morning. He cut some shavings
from a dead, dry branch of fir and put them
under the fly, and brought a bucket of water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
from the creek, and then together they dragged
up the dead tree.</p>
<p>Had the young man been other than he was,
the girl&#8217;s purity, candor, and self-reliance would
have conquered him, and when she withdrew to
the little tent and let fall the frail barrier between
them, she was as safe from intrusion as if she had
taken refuge behind gates of triple brass. Nothing
in all his life had moved him so deeply as her
solicitude, her sweet trust in his honor, and he
sat long in profound meditation. Any man
would be rich in the ownership of her love, he
admitted. That he possessed her pity and her
friendship he knew, and he began to wonder if
he had made a deeper appeal to her than this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be that I am really a man to her,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;I who am only a poor weakling whom
the rain and snow can appall?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he thought of the effect of this night
upon her life. What would Clifford Belden do
now? To what deeps would his rage descend
if he should come to know of it?</p>
<p>Berrie was serene. Twice she spoke from her
couch to say: &#8220;You&#8217;d better go to bed. Daddy
can&#8217;t get here till to-morrow now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay up awhile yet. My boots aren&#8217;t
entirely dried out.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the flame sank low the cold bit, and he
built up the half-burned logs so that they blazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
again. He worked as silently as he could; but
the girl again spoke, with sweet authority:
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you gone to bed yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;ve been asleep. I only got up to
rebuild the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as comfortable as I deserve; it&#8217;s all
schooling, you know. Please go to sleep again.&#8221;
His teeth were chattering as he spoke, but he
added: &#8220;I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a silence she said: &#8220;You must not get
chilled. Bring your bed into the tent. There
is room for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, that isn&#8217;t necessary. I&#8217;m standing
it very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sick!&#8221; she urged, in a voice of
alarm. &#8220;Please drag your bed inside the door.
What would I do if you should have pneumonia
to-morrow? You must not take any risk of a
fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought of a sheltered spot, of something
to break the remorseless wind, overcame his
scruples, and he drew his bed inside the tent and
rearranged it there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re half frozen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your teeth
are chattering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much the cold,&#8221; he stammered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor boy!&#8221; she exclaimed, and rose in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
her bed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get up and heat some water for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be all right, in a few moments,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Please go to sleep. I shall be snug as a bug
in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched his shadowy motions from her
bed, and when at last he had nestled into his
blankets, she said: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t lose your chill
I&#8217;ll heat a rock and put at your feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was ready to cry out in shame of his weakness;
but he lay silent till he could command
his voice, then he said: &#8220;That would drive me
from the country in disgrace. Think of what
the fellows down below will say when they know
of my cold feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t hear of it; and, besides, it is
better to carry a hot-water bag than to be laid
up with a fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her anxiety lessened as his voice resumed its
pleasant tenor flow. &#8220;Dear girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no
one could have been sweeter&mdash;more like a
guardian angel to me. Don&#8217;t place me under
any greater obligation. Go to sleep. I am
better&mdash;much better now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not speak for a few moments, then
in a voice that conveyed to him a knowledge
that his words of endearment had deeply moved
her, she softly said: &#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard her sigh drowsily thereafter once or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
twice, and then she slept, and her slumber redoubled
in him his sense of guardianship, of responsibility.
Lying there in the shelter of her
tent, the whole situation seemed simple, innocent,
and poetic; but looked at from the standpoint
of Clifford Belden it held an accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be helped,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only
thing we can do is to conceal the fact that we
spent the night beneath this tent alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the belief that the way would clear with
the dawn, he, too, fell asleep, while the fire
sputtered and smudged in the fitful mountain
wind.</p>
<p>The second dawn came slowly, as though
crippled by the storm and walled back by the
clouds. Gradually, austerely, the bleak, white
peaks began to define themselves above the firs.
The camp-birds called cheerily from the wet
branches which overhung the smoldering embers
of the fire, and so at last day was abroad
in the sky.</p>
<p>With a dull ache in his bones, Wayland crept
out to the fire and set to work fanning the coals
with his hat, as he had seen the Supervisor do.
He worked desperately till one of the embers
began to angrily sparkle and to smoke. Then
slipping away out of earshot he broke an armful
of dry fir branches to heap above the wet, charred
logs. Soon these twigs broke into flame, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Berrie, awakened by the crackle of the pine
branches, called out: &#8220;Is it daylight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it&#8217;s a very <i>dark</i> daylight. Don&#8217;t
leave your warm bed for the dampness and
cold out here; stay where you are; I&#8217;ll get
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you this morning? Did you sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you had a bad night,&#8221; she insisted,
in a tone which indicated her knowledge
of his suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp life has its disadvantages,&#8221; he admitted,
as he put the coffee-pot on the fire.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m feeling better now. I never fried a
bird in my life, but I&#8217;m going to try it this morning.
I have some water heating for your
bath.&#8221; He put the soap, towel, and basin of
hot water just inside the tent flap. &#8220;Here it is.
I&#8217;m going to bathe in the lake. I must show my
hardihood.&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard her protesting as he went off down
the bank, but his heart was resolute. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
dead yet,&#8221; he said, grimly. &#8220;An invalid who
can spend two such nights as these, and still
face a cold wind, has some vitality in his bones
after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he returned he found the girl full
dressed, alert, and glowing; but she greeted
him with a touch of shyness and self-consciousness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
new to her, and her eyes veiled themselves
before his glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i>, where do you suppose the Supervisor
is?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he&#8217;s at home,&#8221; she replied, quite seriously.
&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to think of him camped in the
high country without bedding or tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oughtn&#8217;t I to take a turn up the trail and
see? I feel guilty somehow&mdash;I must do something!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help matters any by hoofing about
in the mud. No, we&#8217;ll just hold the fort till he
comes, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;ll expect us to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He submitted once more to the force of her
argument, and they ate breakfast in such intimacy
and good cheer that the night&#8217;s discomforts
and anxieties counted for little. As the sun
broke through the clouds Berrie hung out the
bedding in order that its dampness might be
warmed away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may have to camp here again to-night,&#8221;
she explained, demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse things could happen than that,&#8221; he
gallantly answered. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind a month
of it, only I shouldn&#8217;t want it to rain or snow all
the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor boy! You did suffer, didn&#8217;t you? I
was afraid you would. Did you sleep at all?&#8221;
she asked, tenderly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, after I came inside; but, of course, I
was more or less restless expecting your father
to ride up, and then it&#8217;s all rather exciting business
to a novice. I could hear all sorts of birds
and beasts stepping and fluttering about. I was
scared in spite of my best resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny; I never feel that way. I slept
like a log after I knew you were comfortable.
You must have a better bed and more blankets.
It&#8217;s always cold up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sunlight was short-lived. The clouds settled
over the peaks, and ragged wisps of gray
vapor dropped down the timbered slopes of the
prodigious amphitheater in which the lake lay.
Again Berrie made everything snug while her
young woodsman toiled at bringing logs for the
fire.</p>
<p>In truth, he was more elated than he had been
since leaving school, for he was not only doing
a man&#8217;s work in the world, he was serving a
woman in the immemorial way of the hewer of
wood and the carrier of water. His fatigue and
the chill of the morning wore away, and he took
vast pride in dragging long poles down the hillside,
forcing Berrie to acknowledge that he was
astonishingly strong. &#8220;But don&#8217;t overdo it,&#8221;
she warned.</p>
<p>At last fully provided for, they sat contentedly
side by side under the awning and watched the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
falling rain as it splashed and sizzled on the sturdy
fire. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little like being shipwrecked on a
desert island, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;As if our boats
had drifted away.&#8221;</p>
<p>At noon she again prepared an elaborate meal.
She served potatoes and grouse, hot biscuit with
sugar syrup, and canned peaches, and coffee done
to just the right color and aroma. He declared
it wonderful, and they ate with repeated wishes
that the Supervisor might turn up in time to
share their feast; but he did not. Then Berrie
said, firmly: &#8220;Now you must take a snooze, you
look tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was, in truth, not only drowsy but lame
and tired. Therefore, he yielded to her suggestion.</p>
<p>She covered him with blankets and put him
away like a child. &#8220;Now you have a good sleep,&#8221;
she said, tenderly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call you when daddy
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a delicious sense of her protecting care
he lay for a few moments listening to the drip
of the water on the tent, then drifted away into
peace and silence.</p>
<p>When he woke the ground was again covered
with snow, and the girl was feeding the fire with
wood which her own hands had supplied.</p>
<p>Hearing him stir, she turned and fixed her
eyes upon him with clear, soft gaze. &#8220;How do
you feel by now?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Quite made over,&#8221; he replied, rising alertly.</p>
<p>His cheer, however, was only pretense. He
was greatly worried. &#8220;Something has happened
to your father,&#8221; he said. &#8220;His horse has thrown
him, or he has slipped and fallen.&#8221; His peace
and exultation were gone. &#8220;How far is it down
to the ranger station?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About twelve miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better close camp and
go down there? It is now three o&#8217;clock; we can
walk it in five hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, I think we&#8217;d better
stay right here. It&#8217;s a long, hard walk, and
the trail is muddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, dear girl,&#8221; he began, desperately, &#8220;it
won&#8217;t do for us to camp here&mdash;alone&mdash;in this
way another night. What will Cliff say?&#8221;</p>
<p>She flamed red, then whitened. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care
what Cliff thinks&mdash;I&#8217;m done with him&mdash;and no
one that I really care about would blame us.&#8221;
She was fully aware of his anxiety now. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t our fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be <i>my</i> fault if I keep you here longer!&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;We must reach a telephone and
send word out. Something may have happened
to your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried a bit about him. It may
be that there&#8217;s been a big snowfall up above us&mdash;or
else a windstorm. The trail may be blocked;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
but don&#8217;t worry. He may have to go round by
Lost Lake pass.&#8221; She pondered a moment. &#8220;I
reckon you&#8217;re right. We&#8217;d better pack up and
rack down the trail to the ranger&#8217;s cabin. Not
on my account, but on yours. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve
taken cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right, except I&#8217;m very lame; but I am
anxious to go on. By the way, is this ranger
Settle married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, his station is one of the lonesomest cabins
on the forest. No woman will stay there.&#8221;</p>
<p>This made Wayland ponder. &#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221;
he decided, &#8220;we&#8217;ll go. After all, the man is a forest
officer, and you are the Supervisor&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no further protest, but busied herself
closing the panniers and putting away the
camp utensils. She seemed to recognize that
his judgment was sound.</p>
<p>It was after three when they left the tent and
started down the trail, carrying nothing but a
few toilet articles.</p>
<p>He stopped at the edge of the clearing. &#8220;Should
we have left a note for the Supervisor?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to their footprints. &#8220;There&#8217;s all
the writing he needs,&#8221; she assured him, leading
the way at a pace which made him ache. She
plashed plumply into the first puddle in the path.
&#8220;No use dodging &#8217;em,&#8221; she called over her
shoulder, and he soon saw that she was right.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>The trees were dripping, the willows heavy
with water, and the mud ankle-deep&mdash;in places&mdash;but
she pushed on steadily, and he, following in
her tracks, could only marvel at her strength
and sturdy self-reliance. The swing of her
shoulders, the poise of her head, and the lithe
movement of her waist, made his own body
seem a poor thing.</p>
<p>For two hours they zigzagged down a narrow
cañon heavily timbered with fir and spruce&mdash;a
dark, stern avenue, crossed by roaring streams,
and filled with frequent boggy meadows whereon
the water lay mid-leg deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get out of this very soon,&#8221; she called,
cheerily.</p>
<p>By degrees the gorge widened, grew more open,
more genial. Aspen thickets of pale-gold flashed
upon their eyes like sunlight, and grassy bunches
afforded firmer footing, but on the slopes their
feet slipped and slid painfully. Still Berea kept
her stride. &#8220;We must get to the middle fork
before dark,&#8221; she stopped to explain, &#8220;for I don&#8217;t
know the trail down there, and there&#8217;s a lot of
down timber just above the station. Now that
we&#8217;re cut loose from our camp I feel nervous.
As long as I have a tent I am all right; but now
we are in the open I worry. How are you standing
it?&#8221; She studied him with keen and anxious
glance, her hand upon his arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fine as a fiddle,&#8221; he replied, assuming a
spirit he did not possess, &#8220;but you are marvelous.
I thought cowgirls couldn&#8217;t walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do anything when I have to,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got three hours more of it.&#8221;
And she warningly exclaimed: &#8220;Look back
there!&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached a point from which the
range could be seen, and behold it was covered
deep with a seamless robe of new snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why dad didn&#8217;t get back last night.
He&#8217;s probably wallowing along up there this
minute.&#8221; And she set off again with resolute
stride. Wayland&#8217;s pale face and labored breath
alarmed her. She was filled with love and pity,
but she pressed forward desperately.</p>
<p>As he grew tired, Wayland&#8217;s boots, loaded
with mud, became fetters, and every slope greasy
with mire seemed an almost insurmountable
barricade. He fell several times, but made no
outcry. &#8220;I will not add to her anxiety,&#8221; he said
to himself.</p>
<p>At last they came to the valley floor, over which
a devastating fire had run some years before,
and which was still covered with fallen trees in
desolate confusion. Here the girl made her first
mistake. She kept on toward the river, although
Wayland called attention to a trail leading to
the right up over the low grassy hills. For a mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the path was clear, but she soon found herself
confronted by an endless maze of blackened tree-trunks,
and at last the path ended abruptly.</p>
<p>Dismayed and halting, she said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
to go back to that trail which branched off to
the right. I reckon that was the highland trail
which Settle made to keep out of the swamp. I
thought it was a trail from Cameron Peak, but
it wasn&#8217;t. Back we go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was suffering keenly now, not on her own
account, but on his, for she could see that he
was very tired, and to climb up that hill again
was like punishing him a second time.</p>
<p>When she picked up the blazed trail it was so
dark that she could scarcely follow it; but she
felt her way onward, turning often to be sure
that he was following. Once she saw him fall,
and cried out: &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to make you climb
this hill again. It&#8217;s all my fault. I ought to
have known that that lower road led down into
the timber.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing close beside him in the darkness,
knowing that he was weary, wet, and ill, she permitted
herself the expression of her love and pity.
Putting her arm about him, she drew his cheek
against her own, saying: &#8220;Poor boy, your hands
are cold as ice.&#8221; She took them in her own warm
clasp. &#8220;Oh, I wish we had never left the camp!
What does it matter what people say?&#8221; Then
she broke down and wailed. &#8220;I shall never forgive
myself if you&mdash;&#8221; Her voice failed her.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>He bravely reassured her: &#8220;I&#8217;m not defeated,
I&#8217;m just tired. That&#8217;s all. I can go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are shaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is merely a nervous chill. I&#8217;m good
for another hour. It&#8217;s better to keep moving,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thrust her hand under his coat and laid
it over his heart. &#8220;You are tired out,&#8221; she said,
and there was anguish in her voice. &#8220;Your heart
is pounding terribly. You mustn&#8217;t do any more
climbing. And, hark, there&#8217;s a wolf!&#8221;</p>
<p>He listened. &#8220;I hear him; but we are both
armed. There&#8217;s no danger from wild animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; she said, instantly recovering her
natural resolution. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stand here. The
station can&#8217;t be far away. We must go on.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>THE OTHER GIRL</h3>
</div>

<p>The girl&#8217;s voice stirred the benumbed youth
into action again, and he followed her mechanically.
His slender stock of physical
strength was almost gone, but his will remained
unbroken. At every rough place she came back
to him to support him, to hearten him, and so
he crept on through the darkness, falling often,
stumbling against the trees, slipping and sliding,
till at last his guide, pitching down a sharp slope,
came directly upon a wire fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; she called. &#8220;Here is a fence, and
the cabin should be near, although I see no light.
Hello! Tony!&#8221;</p>
<p>No voice replied, and, keeping Wayland&#8217;s hand,
she felt her way along the fence till it revealed
a gate; then she turned toward the roaring of
the stream, which grew louder as they advanced.
&#8220;The cabin is near the falls, that much I know,&#8221;
she assured him. Then a moment later she joyfully
cried out: &#8220;Here it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the darkness a blacker, sharper shadow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
rose. Again she called, but no one answered.
&#8220;The ranger is away,&#8221; she exclaimed, in a voice
of indignant alarm. &#8220;I do hope he left the door
unlocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too numb with fatigue, and too dazed by the
darkness to offer any aid, Wayland waited&mdash;swaying
unsteadily on his feet&mdash;while she tried
the door. It was bolted, and with but a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, she said: &#8220;It looks like a case
of breaking and entering. I&#8217;ll try a window.&#8221;
The windows, too, were securely fastened. After
trying them all, she came back to where Wayland
stood. &#8220;Tony didn&#8217;t intend to have anybody
pushing in,&#8221; she decided. &#8220;But if the
windows will not raise they will smash.&#8221;</p>
<p>A crash of glass followed, and with a feeling
that it was all part of a dream, Wayland waited
while the girl made way through the broken
sash into the dark interior. Her next utterance
was a cry of joy: &#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s nice and warm
in here! I can&#8217;t open the door. You&#8217;ll have
to come in the same way I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was too weak and too irresolute to respond
immediately, and, reaching out, she took him by
the arms and dragged him across the sill. Her
strength seemed prodigious. A delicious warmth,
a grateful dryness, a sense of shelter enfolded
him like a garment. The place smelled deliciously
of food, of fire, of tobacco.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Leading him toward the middle of the room,
Berrie said: &#8220;Stand here till I strike a light.&#8221;</p>
<p>As her match flamed up Norcross found himself
in a rough-walled cabin, in which stood a
square cook-stove, a rude table littered with
dishes, and three stools made of slabs. It was
all very rude; but it had all the value of a palace
at the moment.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s quick eye saw much else. She
located an oil-lamp, some pine-wood, and a corner
cupboard. In a few moments the lamp was
lit, the stove refilled with fuel, and she was
stripping Wayland&#8217;s wet coat from his back,
cheerily discoursing as she did so. &#8220;Here&#8217;s one
of Tony&#8217;s old jackets, put that on while I see if
I can&#8217;t find some dry stockings for you. Sit
right down here by the stove; put your feet in
the oven. I&#8217;ll have a fire in a jiffy. There,
that&#8217;s right. Now I&#8217;ll start the coffee-pot.&#8221; She
soon found the coffee, but it was unground.
&#8220;Wonder, where he keeps his coffee-mill.&#8221; She
rummaged about for a few minutes, then gave
up the search. &#8220;Well, no matter, here&#8217;s the
coffee, and here&#8217;s a hammer. One of the laws
of the trail is this: If you can&#8217;t do a thing one
way, do it another.&#8221;</p>
<p>She poured the coffee beans into an empty
tomato-can and began to pound them with the
end of the hammer handle, laughing at Wayland&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
look of wonder and admiration. &#8220;Necessity
sure is the mother of invention out here.
How do you feel by now? Isn&#8217;t it nice to own
a roof and four walls? I&#8217;m going to close up
that window as soon as I get the coffee started.
Are you warming up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;m all right now,&#8221; he replied; but
he didn&#8217;t look it, and her own cheer was rather
forced. He was in the grasp of a nervous chill,
and she was deeply apprehensive of what the
result of his exposure might be. It seemed as
if the coffee would never come to a boil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I depend on that to brace you up,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After hanging a blanket over the broken window,
she set out some cold meat and a half
dozen baking-powder biscuits, which she found
in the cupboard, and as soon as the coffee was
ready she poured it for him; but she would not
let him leave the fire. She brought his supper
to him and sat beside him while he ate and drank.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go right to bed,&#8221; she urged, as she
studied his weary eyes. &#8220;You ought to sleep for
twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hot, strong coffee revived him physically
and brought back a little of his courage, and he
said: &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed to be such a weakling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hush,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
your fault that you are weak. Now, while I am
eating my supper you slip off your wet clothes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
and creep into Tony&#8217;s bunk, and I&#8217;ll fill one of
these syrup-cans with hot water to put at your
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was of no use for him to protest against her
further care. She insisted, and while she ate he
meekly carried out her instructions, and from
the delicious warmth and security of his bed
watched her moving about the stove till the
shadows of the room became one with the dusky
figures of his sleep.</p>
<p>A moment later something falling on the floor
woke him with a start, and, looking up, he found
the sun shining, and Berrie confronting him with
anxious face. &#8220;Did I waken you?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry. I&#8217;m trying to be extra
quiet. I dropped a pan. How do you feel this
<i>morning</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pondered this question a moment. &#8220;Is it
to-morrow or the next week?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed happily. &#8220;It&#8217;s only the next day.
Just keep where you are till the sun gets a little
higher.&#8221; She drew near and put a hand on his
brow. &#8220;You don&#8217;t feel feverish. Oh, I hope
this trip hasn&#8217;t set you back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid his hands together, and then felt of his
pulse. &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to have a temperature.
I just feel lazy, limp and lazy; but I&#8217;m going to
get up, if you&#8217;ll just leave the room for a moment&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try it now. Wait till you have had
your breakfast. You&#8217;ll feel stronger then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He yielded again to the force of her will, and
fell back into a luxurious drowse hearing the
stove roar and the bacon sizzle in the pan.
There was something primitive and broadly
poetic in the girl&#8217;s actions. Through the haze of
the kitchen smoke she enlarged till she became
the typical frontier wife, the goddess of the
skillet and the coffee-pot, the consort of the
pioneer, equally skilled with the rifle and the
rolling-pin. How many millions of times had
this scene been enacted on the long march of
the borderman from the Susquehanna to the
Bear Tooth Range?</p>
<p>Into his epic vision the pitiful absurdity of his
own part in the play broke like a sad discord.
&#8220;Of course, it is not my fault that I am a weakling,&#8221;
he argued. &#8220;Only it was foolish for me
to thrust myself into this stern world. If I
come safely out of this adventure I will go back
to the sheltered places where I belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point came again the disturbing realization
that this night of struggle, and the
ministrations of his brave companion had involved
him deeper in a mesh from which honorable
escape was almost impossible. The ranger&#8217;s
cabin, so far from being an end of their compromising
intimacy, had added and was still adding to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the weight of evidence against them both. The
presence of the ranger or the Supervisor himself
could not now save Berea from the gossips.</p>
<p>She brought his breakfast to him, and sat beside
him while he ate, chatting the while of their
good fortune. &#8220;It is glorious outside, and I am
sure daddy will get across to-day, and Tony is
certain to turn up before noon. He probably
went down to Coal City to get his mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get up at once,&#8221; he said, in a panic
of fear and shame. &#8220;The Supervisor must not
find me laid out on my back. Please leave me
alone for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went out, closing the door behind her, and
as he crawled from his bed every muscle in his
body seemed to cry out against being moved.
Nevertheless, he persisted, and at last succeeded
in putting on his clothes, even his shoes&mdash;though
he found tying the laces the hardest task of all&mdash;and
he was at the wash-basin bathing his face
and hands when Berrie hurriedly re-entered.
&#8220;Some tourists are coming,&#8221; she announced, in
an excited tone. &#8220;A party of five or six people,
a woman among them, is just coming down the
slope. Now, who do you suppose it can be? It
would be just our luck if it should turn out to be
some one from the Mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He divined at once the reason for her dismay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
The visit of a woman at this moment would not
merely embarrass them both, it would torture
Berrie. &#8220;What is to be done?&#8221; he asked, roused
to alertness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing; all we can do is to stand pat and
act as if we belonged here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he replied, moving stiffly toward
the door. &#8220;Here&#8217;s where I can be of some service.
I am an excellent white liar.&#8221;</p>
<p>As our hero crawled out into the brilliant sunshine
some part of his courage came back to
him. Though lame in every muscle, he was not
ill. That was the surprising thing. His head
was clear, and his breath full and deep. &#8220;My
lungs are all right,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not going to collapse.&#8221; And he looked round
him with a new-born admiration of the wooded
hills which rose in somber majesty on either side
the roaring stream. &#8220;How different it all looks
this morning,&#8221; he said, remembering the deep
blackness of the night.</p>
<p>The beat of hoofs upon the bridge drew his
attention to the cavalcade, which the keen eyes
of the girl had detected as it came over the ridge
to the east. The party consisted of two men
and two women and three pack-horses completely
outfitted for the trail.</p>
<p>One of the women, spurring her horse to the
front, rode serenely up to where Wayland stood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
and called out: &#8220;Good morning. Are you the
ranger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m only the guard. The ranger has
gone down the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>He perceived at once that the speaker was an
alien like himself, for she wore tan-colored riding-boots,
a divided skirt of expensive cloth, and a
jaunty, wide-rimmed sombrero. She looked, indeed,
precisely like the heroine of the prevalent
Western drama. Her sleeves, rolled to the elbow,
disclosed shapely brown arms, and her neck,
bare to her bosom, was equally sun-smit; but
she was so round-cheeked, so childishly charming,
that the most critical observer could find no fault
with her make-up.</p>
<p>One of the men rode up. &#8220;Hello, Norcross.
What are you doing over here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth smiled blandly. &#8220;Good morning,
Mr. Belden. I&#8217;m serving my apprenticeship.
I&#8217;m in the service now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mischief you are!&#8221; exclaimed the other.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Tony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone for his mail. He&#8217;ll return soon. What
are <i>you</i> doing over here, may I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here as guide to Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore,
this is Norcross, one of McFarlane&#8217;s men. Mr.
Moore is connected with the tie-camp operations
of the railway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moore was a tall, thin man with a gray beard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
and keen blue eyes. &#8220;Where&#8217;s McFarlane? We
were to meet him here. Didn&#8217;t he come over
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started together, but the horses got away,
and he was obliged to go back after them. He
also is likely to turn up soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am frightfully hungry,&#8221; interrupted the
girl. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you hand me out a hunk of bread
and meat? We&#8217;ve been riding since daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie suddenly appeared at the door. &#8220;Sure
thing,&#8221; she called out. &#8220;Slide down and come
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moore removed his hat and bowed. &#8220;Good
morning, Miss McFarlane, I didn&#8217;t know you
were here. You know my daughter Siona?&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie nodded coldly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He indicated the other woman. &#8220;And Mrs.
Belden, of course, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Belden, the fourth member of the party,
a middle-aged, rather flabby person, just being
eased down from her horse, turned on Berrie
with a battery of questions. &#8220;Good Lord! Berrie
McFarlane, what are you doing over in
this forsaken hole? Where&#8217;s your dad? And
where is Tony? If Cliff had known you was over
here he&#8217;d have come, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie retained her self-possession. &#8220;Come in
and get some coffee, and we&#8217;ll straighten things
out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Apparently Mrs. Belden did not know that
Cliff and Berrie had quarreled, for she treated
the girl with maternal familiarity. She was a
good-natured, well-intentioned old sloven, but
a most renowned tattler, and the girl feared her
more than she feared any other woman in the
valley. She had always avoided her, but she
showed nothing of this dislike at the moment.</p>
<p>Wayland drew the younger woman&#8217;s attention
by saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s plain that you, like myself, do
not belong to these parts, Miss Moore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221; she brightly
queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your costume is too appropriate. Haven&#8217;t
you noticed that the women who live out here
carefully avoid convenient and artistic dress?
Now your outfit is precisely what they should
wear and don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>This amused her. &#8220;I know, but they all say
they have to wear out their Sunday go-to-meeting
clothes, whereas I can &#8216;rag out proper.&#8217;
I&#8217;m glad you like my &#8216;rig.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I look at you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m back on
old Broadway at the Herald Square Theater.
The play is &#8216;Little Blossom, or the Cowgirl&#8217;s
Revenge.&#8217; The heroine has just come into the
miner&#8217;s cabin&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go &#8217;long,&#8221; she replied, seizing her cue and
speaking in character, &#8220;you&#8217;re stringin&#8217; me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life! Your outfit is a peacherino,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;I am glad you rode by.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the moment he was bent on drawing the girl&#8217;s
attention from Berrie, but as she went on he
came to like her. She said: &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t belong
here; but I come out every year during vacation
with my father. I love this country. It&#8217;s so
big and wide and wild. Father has built a little
bungalow down at the lower mill, and we enjoy
every day of our stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a Smith girl,&#8221; he abruptly asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s something about you Smith girls
that gives you dead away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gives us away! I like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My phrase was unfortunate. I like Smith
girls,&#8221; he hastened to say; and in five minutes
they were on the friendliest terms&mdash;talking of
mutual acquaintances&mdash;a fact which both puzzled
and hurt Berea. Their laughter angered
her, and whenever she glanced at them and detected
Siona looking into Wayland&#8217;s face with coquettish
simper, she was embittered. She was glad
when Moore came in and interrupted the dialogue.</p>
<p>Norcross did not relax, though he considered
the dangers of cross-examination almost entirely
passed. In this he was mistaken, for no sooner
was the keen edge of Mrs. Belden&#8217;s hunger dulled
than her curiosity sharpened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you say the Supervisor was?&#8221; she
repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The horses got away, and he had to go back
after them,&#8221; again responded Berrie, who found
the scrutiny of the other girl deeply disconcerting.</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you expect him back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any minute now,&#8221; she replied, and in this
she was not deceiving them, although she did
not intend to volunteer any information which
might embarrass either Wayland or herself.</p>
<p>Norcross tried to create a diversion. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
this a charming valley?&#8221;</p>
<p>Siona took up the cue. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it! It&#8217;s romantic
enough to be the back-drop in a Bret
Harte play. I love it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Moore turned to Wayland. &#8220;I know a Norcross,
a Michigan lumberman, Vice-President of
the Association. Is he, by any chance, a relative?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a father,&#8221; retorted Wayland, with a
smile. &#8220;But don&#8217;t hold me responsible for anything
he has done. We seldom agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s manner changed abruptly. &#8220;Indeed!
And what is the son of W. W. Norcross doing
out here in the Forest Service?&#8221;</p>
<p>The change in her father&#8217;s tone was not lost
upon Siona, who ceased her banter and studied
the young man with deeper interest, while Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Belden, detecting some restraint in Berrie&#8217;s
tone, renewed her questioning: &#8220;Where did you
camp last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how the horses got away. There&#8217;s
a pasture here, for we rode right through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie was aware that each moment of delay
in explaining the situation looked like evasion,
and deepened the significance of her predicament,
and yet she could not bring herself to the
task of minutely accounting for her time during
the last two days.</p>
<p>Belden came to her relief. &#8220;Well, well!
We&#8217;ll have to be moving on. We&#8217;re going into
camp at the mouth of the West Fork,&#8221; he said,
as he rose. &#8220;Tell Tony and the Supervisor that
we want to line out that timber at the earliest
possible moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siona, who was now distinctly coquetting with
Wayland, held out her hand. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll find
time to come up and see us. I know we have
other mutual friends, if we had time to get at
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>His answer was humorous. &#8220;I am a soldier.
I am on duty. I&#8217;m not at all sure that I shall
have a moment&#8217;s leave; but I will call if I can
possibly do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started off at last without having learned
in detail anything of the intimate relationship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
into which the Supervisor&#8217;s daughter and young
Norcross had been thrown, and Mrs. Belden was
still so much in the dark that she called to Berrie:
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send word to Cliff that you
are over here. He&#8217;ll be crazy to come the minute
he finds it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; protested Berrie.</p>
<p>Wayland turned to Berrie. &#8220;That would be
pleasant,&#8221; he said, smilingly.</p>
<p>But she did not return his smile. On the
contrary, she remained very grave. &#8220;I wish that
old tale-bearer had kept away. She&#8217;s going to
make trouble for us all. And that girl, isn&#8217;t she
a spectacle? I never could bear her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s wrong with her? She seems a
very nice, sprightly person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a regular play actor. I don&#8217;t like
made-up people. Why does she go around with
her sleeves rolled up that way, and&mdash;and her
dress open at the throat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, those are the affectations of the moment.
She wants to look tough and boisterous. That&#8217;s
the fad with all the girls, just now. It&#8217;s only a
harmless piece of foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not tell him how deeply she resented
his ready tone of camaraderie with the other
girl; but she was secretly suffering. It hurt her
to think that he could forget his aches and be
so free and easy with a stranger at a moment&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
notice. Under the influence of that girl&#8217;s smile
he seemed to have quite forgotten his exhaustion
and his pain. It was wonderful how cheerful he
had been while she was in sight.</p>
<p>In all this Berrie did him an injustice. He had
been keenly conscious, during every moment of
the time, not only of his bodily ills, but of Berrie,
and he had kept a brave face in order that he
might prevent further questioning on the part
of a malicious girl. It was his only way of being
heroic. Now that the crisis was passed he was
quite as much of a wreck as ever.</p>
<p>A new anxiety beset her. &#8220;I hope they won&#8217;t
happen to meet father on the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should go with them and warn
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; she wearily answered.
&#8220;Old Mrs. Belden will never rest till she finds
out just where we&#8217;ve been, and just what we&#8217;ve
done. She&#8217;s that kind. She knows everything
that goes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He understood her fear, and yet he was unable
to comfort her in the only way she could be
comforted. That brief encounter with Siona
Moore&mdash;a girl of his own world&mdash;had made all
thought of marriage with Berea suddenly absurd.
Without losing in any degree the sense of gratitude
he felt for her protecting care, and with full
acknowledgment of her heroic support of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
faltering feet, he revolted from putting into
words a proposal of marriage. &#8220;I love her,&#8221; he
confessed to himself, &#8220;and she is a dear, brave
girl; but I do not love her as a man should love
the woman he is to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gray shadow had plainly fallen between
them. Berea sensed the change in his attitude,
and traced it to the influence of the coquette
whose smiling eyes and bared arms had openly
challenged admiration. It saddened her to
think that one so fine as he had seemed could
yield even momentary tribute to an open and
silly coquette.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>FURTHER PERPLEXITIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Wayland, for his part, was not deceived
by Siona Moore. He knew her kind, and
understood her method of attack. He liked her
pert ways, for they brought back his days at
college, when dozens of just such misses lent
grace and humor and romance to the tennis court
and to the football field. She carried with her
the aroma of care-free, athletic girlhood. Flirtation
was in her as charming and almost as meaningless
as the preening of birds on the bank of a
pool in the meadow.</p>
<p>Speaking aloud, he said: &#8220;Miss Moore travels
the trail with all known accessories, and I&#8217;ve no
doubt she thinks she is a grand campaigner;
but I am wondering how she would stand such a
trip as that you took last night. I don&#8217;t believe
she could have done as well as I. She&#8217;s the imitation&mdash;you&#8217;re
the real thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The praise involved in this speech brought
back a little of Berrie&#8217;s humor. &#8220;I reckon those
brown boots of hers would have melted,&#8221; she
said, with quaint smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>He became very grave. &#8220;If it had not been
for you, dear girl, I would be lying up there in
the forest this minute. Nothing but your indomitable
spirit kept me moving. I shall be
deeply hurt if any harm comes to you on account
of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for me you wouldn&#8217;t have
started on that trip last night. It was perfectly
useless. It would have been better for us both
if we had stayed in camp, for we wouldn&#8217;t have
met these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;but we didn&#8217;t
know that at the time. We acted for the best,
and we must not blame ourselves, no matter
what comes of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They fell silent at this point, for each was again
conscious of their new relationship. She, vaguely
suffering, waited for him to resume the lover&#8217;s
tone, while he, oppressed by the sense of his own
shortcomings and weakness, was planning an
escape. &#8220;It&#8217;s all nonsense, my remaining in the
forest. I&#8217;m not fitted for it. It&#8217;s too severe.
I&#8217;ll tell McFarlane so and get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perceiving his returning weakness and depression,
Berea insisted on his lying down again
while she set to work preparing dinner. &#8220;There
is no telling when father will get here,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;And Tony will be hungry when he comes.
Lie down and rest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>He obeyed her silently, and, going to the bunk,
at once fell asleep. How long he slept he could
not tell, but he was awakened by the voice of the
ranger, who was standing in the doorway and
regarding Berrie with a round-eyed stare.</p>
<p>He was a tall, awkward fellow of about thirty-five,
plainly of the frontier type; but a man of
intelligence. At the end of a brief explanation
Berrie said, with an air of authority: &#8220;Now you&#8217;d
better ride up the trail and bring our camp
outfit down. We can&#8217;t go back that way, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger glanced toward Wayland. &#8220;All
right, Miss Berrie, but perhaps your tenderfoot
needs a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland rose painfully but resolutely. &#8220;Oh
no, I am not sick. I&#8217;m a little lame, that&#8217;s all.
I&#8217;ll go along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Berrie, decisively. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
well enough for that. Get up your horses, Tony,
and by that time I&#8217;ll have some dinner ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Berrie,&#8221; replied the man, and
turned away.</p>
<p>Hardly had he crossed the bridge on his way
to the pasture, when Berrie cried out: &#8220;There
comes daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland joined her at the door, and stood
beside her watching the Supervisor, as he came
zigzagging down the steep hill to the east, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
all his horses trailing behind him roped together
head-to-tail.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s had to come round by Lost Lake,&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be tired out, and absolutely
starved. Wahoo!&#8221; she shouted in greeting, and
the Supervisor waved his hand.</p>
<p>There was something superb in the calm seat
of the veteran as he slid down the slope. He
kept his place in the saddle with the air of the
rider to whom hunger, fatigue, windfalls, and
snowslides were all a part of the day&#8217;s work; and
when he reined in before the door and dropped
from his horse, he put his arm about his daughter&#8217;s
neck with quiet word: &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d find
you here. How is everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, daddy; but what about you?
Where have you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean back to Mill Park. The blamed
cayuses kept just ahead of me all the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old dad! And on top of that came the
snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and a whole hatful. I couldn&#8217;t get back
over the high pass. Had to go round by Lost
Lake, and to cap all, Old Baldy took a notion
not to lead. Oh, I&#8217;ve had a peach of a time;
but here I am. Have you seen Moore and his
party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re in camp up the trail. He and
Alec Belden and two women. Are you hungry?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>He turned a comical glance upon her. &#8220;Am
I hungry? Sister, I am a wolf. Norcross, take
my horses down to the pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hastened to interpose. &#8220;Let me do that,
daddy, Mr. Norcross is badly used up. You
see, we started down here late yesterday afternoon.
It was raining and horribly muddy, and
I took the wrong trail. The darkness caught us
and we didn&#8217;t reach the station till nearly midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland acknowledged his weakness. &#8220;I
guess I made a mistake, Supervisor; I&#8217;m not
fitted for this strenuous life.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane was quick to understand. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t intend to pitchfork you into the forest
life quite so suddenly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give
up yet awhile. You&#8217;ll harden to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Tony,&#8221; said Berrie. &#8220;He&#8217;ll look
after the ponies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Wayland went out, believing that
Berrie wished to be alone with her father for a
short time.</p>
<p>As he took his seat McFarlane said: &#8220;You
stayed in camp till yesterday afternoon, did
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we were expecting you every moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw nothing in this to remark upon. &#8220;Did
it snow at the lake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a little; it mostly rained.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It stormed up on the divide like a January
blizzard. When did Moore and his party arrive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About ten o&#8217;clock this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride right up and see them. What about
the outfit? That&#8217;s at the lake, I reckon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was just sending Tony after it. But,
father, if you go up to Moore&#8217;s camp, don&#8217;t say
too much about what has happened. Don&#8217;t tell
them just when you took the back-trail, and just
how long Wayland and I were in camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reddened with confusion. &#8220;Because&mdash;You
know what an old gossip Mrs. Belden is.
I don&#8217;t want her to know. She&#8217;s an awful talker,
and our being together up there all that time
will give her a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>A light broke in on the Supervisor&#8217;s brain. In
the midst of his preoccupation as a forester he
suddenly became the father. His eyes narrowed
and his face darkened. &#8220;That&#8217;s so. The old
rip could make a whole lot of capital out of your
being left in camp that way. At the same time
I don&#8217;t believe in dodging. The worst thing we
could do would be to try to blind the trail. Was
Tony here last night when you came?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he was down the valley after his mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face darkened again. &#8220;That&#8217;s another
piece of bad luck, too. How much does the old
woman know at present?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she cross-examine you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure she did; but Wayland side-tracked her.
Of course it only delays things. She&#8217;ll know all
about it sooner or later. She&#8217;s great at putting
two and two together. Two and two with her
always make five.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane mused. &#8220;Cliff will be plumb crazy
if she gets his ear first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care anything about Cliff, daddy.
I don&#8217;t care what he thinks or does, if he will only
let Wayland alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, daughter, you do seem to be terribly
interested in this tourist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the finest man I ever knew, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with tender, trusting glance.
&#8220;He isn&#8217;t your kind, daughter. He&#8217;s a nice
clean boy, but he&#8217;s different. He don&#8217;t belong
in our world. He&#8217;s only just stopping here.
Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not forgetting that, daddy. I know he&#8217;s
different, that&#8217;s why I like him.&#8221; After a pause
she added: &#8220;Nobody could have been nicer all
through these days than he has been. He was
like a brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane fixed a keen glance upon her.
&#8220;Has he said anything to you? Did you come
to an understanding?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell. &#8220;Not the way you mean,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
daddy; but I think he&mdash;likes me. But do you
know who he is? He&#8217;s the son of W. W. Norcross,
that big Michigan lumberman.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane started. &#8220;How do you know
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Moore asked him if he was any relation
to W.W. Norcross, and he said, &#8216;Yes, a son.&#8217;
You should have seen how that Moore girl
changed her tune the moment he admitted that.
She&#8217;d been very free with him up to that time;
but when she found out he was a rich man&#8217;s son
she became as quiet and innocent as a kitten. I
hate her; she&#8217;s a deceitful snip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, daughter, that being the case, it&#8217;s
all the more certain that he don&#8217;t belong to our
world, and you mustn&#8217;t fix your mind on keeping
him here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl can&#8217;t help fixing her mind, daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or changing it.&#8221; He smiled a little. &#8220;You
used to like Cliff. You liked him well enough to
promise to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I did; but I despise him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Cliff! He isn&#8217;t so much to blame after
all. Any man is likely to flare out when he finds
another fellow cutting in ahead of him. Why,
here you are wanting to kill Siona Moore just
for making up to your young tourist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s different.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Of course it is. But the thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
we&#8217;ve got to guard against is old lady Belden&#8217;s
tongue. She and that Belden gang have it in
for me, and all that has kept them from open
war has been Cliff&#8217;s relationship to you. They&#8217;ll
take a keen delight in making the worst of all
this camping business.&#8221; McFarlane was now
very grave. &#8220;I wish your mother was here this
minute. I guess we had better cut out this
timber cruise and go right back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t do that; that would only
make more talk. Go on with your plans. I&#8217;ll
stay here with you. It won&#8217;t take you but a
couple of days to do the work, and Wayland needs
the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose Cliff hears of this business between
you and Norcross and comes galloping
over the ridge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let him, he has no claim on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose uneasily. &#8220;It&#8217;s all mighty risky business,
and it&#8217;s my fault. I should never have permitted
you to start on this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about me, daddy, I&#8217;ll pull
through somehow. Anybody that knows me
will understand how little there is in&mdash;in old
lady Belden&#8217;s gab. I&#8217;ve had a beautiful trip,
and I won&#8217;t let her nor anybody else spoil it for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane was not merely troubled. He was
distracted. He was afraid to meet the Beldens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
He dreaded their questions, their innuendoes.
He had perfect faith in his daughter&#8217;s purity
and honesty, and he liked and trusted Norcross,
and yet he knew that should Belden find it to his
advantage to slander these young people, and
to read into their action the lawlessness of his
own youth, Berea&#8217;s reputation, high as it was,
would suffer, and her mother&#8217;s heart be rent with
anxiety. In his growing pain and perplexity he
decided to speak frankly to young Norcross himself.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a gentleman, and knows the way of
the world. Perhaps he&#8217;ll have some suggestion
to offer.&#8221; In his heart he hoped to learn that
Wayland loved his daughter and wished to marry
her.</p>
<p>Wayland was down on the bridge leaning over
the rail, listening to the song of the water.</p>
<p>McFarlane approached gravely, but when he
spoke it was in his usual soft monotone. &#8220;Mr.
Norcross,&#8221; he began, with candid inflection, &#8220;I
am very sorry to say it; but I wish you and my
daughter had never started on this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean, Supervisor, and I
feel as you do about it. Of course, none of us
foresaw any such complication as this, but now
that we are snarled up in it we&#8217;ll have to make
the best of it. No one of us is to blame. It was
all accidental.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth&#8217;s frank words and his sympathetic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
voice disarmed McFarlane completely. Even
the slight resentment he felt melted away. &#8220;It&#8217;s
no use saying <i>if</i>,&#8221; he remarked, at length.
&#8220;What we&#8217;ve got to meet is Seth Belden&#8217;s report&mdash;Berrie
has cut loose from Cliff, and he&#8217;s
red-headed already. When he drops onto this
story, when he learns that I had to chase back
after the horses, and that you and Berrie were
alone together for three days, he&#8217;ll have a fine club
to swing, and he&#8217;ll swing it; and Alec will help
him. They&#8217;re all waiting a chance to get me, and
they&#8217;re mean enough to get me through my girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; asked Wayland.</p>
<p>McFarlane pondered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to head off
Marm Belden, and I&#8217;ll have a talk with Moore.
He&#8217;s a pretty reasonable chap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you forget there&#8217;s another tale-bearer.
Moore&#8217;s daughter is with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. I&#8217;d forgotten her. Good Lord!
we are in for it. There&#8217;s no use trying to cover
anything up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was the place for Norcross to speak up
and say: &#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;m going to ask Berrie
to be my wife.&#8221; But he couldn&#8217;t do it. Something
rose in his throat which prevented speech.
A strange repugnance, a kind of sullen resentment
at being forced into a declaration, kept him
silent, and McFarlane, disappointed, wondering
and hurt, kept silence also.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Norcross was the first to speak. &#8220;Of course
those who know your daughter will not listen for
an instant to the story of an unclean old thing
like Mrs. Belden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about that,&#8221; replied the father,
gloomily. &#8220;People always listen to such stories,
and a girl always gets the worst of a situation
like this. Berrie&#8217;s been brought up to take care
of herself, and she&#8217;s kept clear of criticism so far;
but with Cliff on edge and this old rip snooping
around&mdash;&#8221; His mind suddenly changed.
&#8220;Your being the son of a rich man won&#8217;t
help any. Why didn&#8217;t you tell me who you
were?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it necessary. What difference
does it make? I have nothing to do with my
father&#8217;s business. His notions of forest speculation
are not mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have made a difference with me, and
it might have made a difference with Berrie.
She mightn&#8217;t have been so free with you at the
start, if she&#8217;d known who you were. You looked
sick and kind of lonesome, and that worked on
her sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>was</i> sick and I was lonesome, and she has
been very sweet and lovely to me, and it breaks
my heart to think that her kindness and your
friendship should bring all this trouble and suspicion
upon her. Let&#8217;s go up to the Moore camp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
and have it out with them. I&#8217;ll make any statement
you think best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the less said about it the better,&#8221;
responded the older man. &#8220;I&#8217;m going up to
the camp, but not to talk about my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you help it? They&#8217;ll force the
topic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do, I&#8217;ll force them to let it alone,&#8221;
retorted McFarlane; but he went away disappointed
and sorrowful. The young man&#8217;s evident
avoidance of the subject of marriage hurt
him. He did not perceive, as Norcross did,
that to make an announcement of his daughter&#8217;s
engagement at this moment would be taken as a
confession of shameful need. It is probable that
Berrie herself would not have seen this further
complication.</p>
<p>Each hour added to Wayland&#8217;s sense of helplessness
and bitterness. &#8220;I am in a trap. I can
neither help Berrie nor help myself. Nothing
remains for me but flight, and flight will also
be a confession of guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again, and in far more definite terms, he
perceived the injustice of the world toward
women. Here with Berrie, as in ages upon ages
of other times, the maiden must bear the burden
of reproach. &#8220;In me it will be considered a
joke, a romantic episode, in her a degrading misdemeanor.
And yet what can I do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>When he re-entered the cabin the Supervisor
had returned from the camp, and something in
his manner, as well as in Berrie&#8217;s, revealed the
fact that the situation had not improved.</p>
<p>&#8220;They forced me into a corner,&#8221; McFarlane
said to Wayland, peevishly. &#8220;I lied out of one
night; but they know that you were here last
night. Of course, they were respectful enough
so long as I had an eye on them, but their
tongues are wagging now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was spent in talk on
the forest, and in going over the ranger&#8217;s books,
for the Supervisor continued to plan for Wayland&#8217;s
stay at this station, and the young fellow
thought it best not to refuse at the moment.</p>
<p>As bedtime drew near Settle took a blanket
and went to the corral, and Berrie insisted that
her father and Wayland occupy the bunk.</p>
<p>Norcross protested; but the Supervisor said:
&#8220;Let her alone. She&#8217;s better able to sleep on
the floor than either of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was perfectly true; but, in spite of his
bruised and aching body, the youth would gladly
have taken her place beside the stove. It
seemed pitifully unjust that she should have
this physical hardship in addition to her uneasiness
of mind.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<h3>THE CAMP ON THE PASS</h3>
</div>

<p>Berea suffered a restless night, the most painful
and broken she had known in all her life.
She acknowledged that Siona Moore was prettier,
and that she stood more nearly on Wayland&#8217;s
plane than herself; but the realization of this
fact did not bring surrender&mdash;she was not of
that temper. All her life she had been called
upon to combat the elements, to hold her own
amidst rude men and inconsiderate women, and
she had no intention of yielding her place to a
pert coquette, no matter what the gossips might
say. She had seen this girl many times, but had
refused to visit her house. She had held her in
contempt, now she quite cordially hated her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She shall not have her way with Wayland,&#8221;
she decided. &#8220;I know what she wants&mdash;she
wants him at her side to-morrow; but I will not
have it so. She is trying to get him away from
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more she dwelt on this the hotter her
jealous fever burned. The floor on which she
lay was full of knots. She could not lose herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
in sleep, tired as she was. The planks no longer
turned their soft spots to her flesh, and she rolled
from side to side in torment. She would have
arisen and dressed only she did not care to disturb
the men. The night seemed interminable.</p>
<p>Her plan of action was simple. &#8220;I shall go
home the morrow and take Wayland with me.
I will not have him going with that girl&mdash;that&#8217;s
settled!&#8221; The very thought of his taking Siona&#8217;s
hand in greeting angered her beyond reason.</p>
<p>She had put Cliff Belden completely out of her
mind, and this was characteristic of her. She had
no divided interests, no subtleties, no subterfuges.
Forthright, hot-blooded, frank and simple, she
had centered all her care, all her desires, on this
pale youth whose appeal was at once mystic and
maternal; but her pity was changing to something
deeper, for she was convinced that he was
gaining in strength, that he was in no danger of
relapse. The hard trip of the day before had
seemingly done him no permanent injury; on
the contrary, a few hours&#8217; rest had almost restored
him to his normal self. &#8220;To-morrow he
will be able to ride again.&#8221; And this thought
reconciled her to her hard bed. She did not look
beyond the long, delicious day which they must
spend in returning to the Springs.</p>
<p>She fell asleep at last, and was awakened only
by her father tinkering about the stove.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>She rose alertly, signing to the Supervisor not
to disturb her patient.</p>
<p>However, Norcross also heard the rattle of
the poker, opened his eyes and regarded Berrie
with sleepy smile. &#8220;Good morning, if it <i>is</i>
morning,&#8221; he said, slowly.</p>
<p>She laughed back at him. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost sunup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t tell me! How could I have overslept
like this? Makes me think of the Irishman
who, upon being awakened to an early breakfast
like this, ate it, then said to his employer, an extra
thrifty farmer, &#8216;Two suppers in wan night&mdash;and
hurrah for bed again.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This amused her greatly. &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad. I
hope you got some sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All there was time for.&#8221; His voice changed.
&#8220;I feel like a hound-pup, to be snoring on a downy
couch like this while you were roughing it on the
floor. How did I come to do it? It&#8217;s shameful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me. How are you feeling
this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stretched and yawned. &#8220;Fine! That is,
I&#8217;m sore here and there, but I&#8217;m feeling wonderfully
well. Do you know, I begin to hope that I
can finally dominate the wilderness. Wouldn&#8217;t
it be wonderful if I got so I could ride and walk
as you do, for instance? The fact that I&#8217;m not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
dead this morning is encouraging.&#8221; He drew
on his shoes as he talked, while she went about
her toilet, which was quite as simple as his own.
She had spent two nights in her day dress with
almost no bathing facilities; but that didn&#8217;t
trouble her. It was a part of the game. She
washed her face and hands in Settle&#8217;s tin basin,
but drew the line at his rubber comb.</p>
<p>There was a distinct charm in seeing her thus
adapting herself to the cabin, a charm quite as
powerful as that which emanated from Siona
Moore&#8217;s dainty and theatrical personality. What
it was he could not define, but the forester&#8217;s
daughter had something primeval about her,
something close to the soil, something which
aureoles the old Saxon words&mdash;<i>wife</i> and <i>home</i> and
<i>fireplace</i>. Seeing her through the savory steam
of the bacon she was frying, he forgot her marvelous
skill as horsewoman and pathfinder, and
thought of her only as the housewife. She belonged
here, in this cabin. She was fitted to this
landscape, whereas the other woman was alien
and dissonant.</p>
<p>He moved his arms about and shook his legs
with comical effect of trying to see if they were
still properly hinged. &#8220;It&#8217;s miraculous! I&#8217;m
not lame at all. No one can accuse me of being
a &#8216;lunger&#8217; now. Last night&#8217;s sleep has made a new
man of me. I&#8217;ve met the forest and it is mine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>She beamed upon him with happy pride. &#8220;I&#8217;m
mighty glad to hear you say that. I was terribly
afraid that long, hard walk in the rain had been
too much for you. I reckon you&#8217;re all right for
the work now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He recalled, as she spoke, her anguish of pity
while they stood in the darkness of the trail, and
it seemed that he could go no farther, and he said,
soberly: &#8220;It must have seemed to you one while
as if I were all in. I felt that way myself. I
was numb from head to heel. I couldn&#8217;t have
gone another mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face clouded with retrospective pain. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t try any more such stunts&mdash;not for a few
weeks, anyway. But get ready for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out into the morning exultantly, and
ran down to the river to bathe his face and hands,
allured by its splendid voice. The world seemed
very bright and beautiful and health-giving once
more.</p>
<p>As soon as she was alone with her father, Berrie
said: &#8220;I&#8217;m going home to-day, dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going home! What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at her bed on the floor. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
say I blame you any. This has been a rough trip;
but we&#8217;ll go up and bring down the outfit, and
then we men can sleep in the tent and let you
have the bunk&mdash;you&#8217;ll be comfortable to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind sleeping on the floor,&#8221; she
replied; &#8220;but I want to get back. I don&#8217;t want
to meet those women. Another thing, you&#8217;d
better use Mr. Norcross at the Springs instead
of leaving him here with Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he isn&#8217;t quite well enough to run the
risk. It&#8217;s a long way from here to a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He &#8217;pears to be on deck this morning. Besides,
I haven&#8217;t anything in the office to offer him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then send him up to Meeker. Landon needs
help, and he&#8217;s a better forester than Tony, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Cliff? He may make trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face darkened. &#8220;Cliff will reach him if he
wants to&mdash;no matter where he is. And then,
too, Landon likes Mr. Norcross and will see that
he is not abused.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane ruminated over her suggestion, well
knowing that she was planning this change in
order that she might have Norcross a little
nearer, a little more accessible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but you&#8217;re right. Landon is
almost as good a hustler as Tony, and a much
better forester. I thought of sending Norcross
up there at first, but he told me that Frank and
his gang had it in for him. Of course, he&#8217;s only
nominally in the service; but I want him to begin
right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>Berrie went further. &#8220;I want him to ride
back with me to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with grave inquiry. &#8220;Do you
think that a wise thing to do? Won&#8217;t that make
more talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start early and ride straight through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go by Lost Lake, and that
means a long, hard hike. Can he stand it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes. He rides well. It&#8217;s the walking at
a high altitude that does him up. Furthermore,
Cliff may turn up here, and I don&#8217;t want another
mix-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane was troubled. &#8220;I ought to go
back with you; but Moore is over here to line
out a cutting, and I must stay on for a couple
of days. Suppose I send Tony along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Tony would be a nuisance and would do
no good. Another day on the trail won&#8217;t add to
Mrs. Belden&#8217;s story. If she wants to be mean
she&#8217;s got all the material for it already.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end she had her way. McFarlane, perceiving
that she had set her heart on this ride,
and having perfect faith in her skill and judgment
on the trail, finally said: &#8220;Well, if you do
so, the quicker you start the better. With the
best of luck you can&#8217;t pull in before eight o&#8217;clock,
and you&#8217;ll have to ride hard to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I find we can&#8217;t make it I&#8217;ll pull into a
ranch. But I&#8217;m sure we can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>When Wayland came in the Supervisor inquired:
&#8220;Do you feel able to ride back over the
hill to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely so. It isn&#8217;t the riding that uses
me up; it is the walking; and, besides, as candidate
for promotion I must obey orders&mdash;especially
orders to march.&#8221;</p>
<p>They breakfasted hurriedly, and while McFarlane
and Tony were bringing in the horses Wayland
and Berrie set the cabin to rights. Working
thus side by side, she recovered her dominion
over him, and at the same time regained her own
cheerful self-confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he
watched her deft adjustment of the dishes and
furniture. &#8220;You&#8217;re ambidextrous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to be to hold my job,&#8221; she laughingly
replied. &#8220;A feller must play all the parts when
he&#8217;s up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was still early morning as they mounted and
set off up the trail; but Moore&#8217;s camp was astir,
and as McFarlane turned in&mdash;much against
Berrie&#8217;s will&mdash;the lumberman and his daughter
both came out to meet them. &#8220;Come in and
have some breakfast,&#8221; said Siona, with cordial
inclusiveness, while her eyes met Wayland&#8217;s
glance with mocking glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said McFarlane, &#8220;we can&#8217;t
stop. I&#8217;m going to set my daughter over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
divide. She has had enough camping, and Norcross
is pretty well battered up, so I&#8217;m going to
help them across. I&#8217;ll be back to-night, and we&#8217;ll
take our turn up the valley to-morrow. Nash
will be here then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie did not mind her father&#8217;s explanation;
on the contrary, she took a distinct pleasure in
letting the other girl know of the long and intimate
day she was about to spend with her young
lover.</p>
<p>Siona, too adroit to display her disappointment,
expressed polite regret. &#8220;I hope you
won&#8217;t get storm-bound,&#8221; she said, showing her
white teeth in a meaning smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is any sign of a storm we won&#8217;t
cross,&#8221; declared McFarlane. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
round by the lower pass, anyhow. If I&#8217;m not
here by dark, you may know I&#8217;ve stayed to set
&#8217;em down at the Mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was charm in Siona&#8217;s alert poise, and in
the neatness of her camp dress. Her dainty tent,
with its stools and rugs, made the wilderness seem
but a park. She reminded Norcross of the troops
of tourists of the Tyrol, and her tent was of a
kind to harmonize with the tea-houses on the
path to the summit of the Matterhorn. Then,
too, something triumphantly feminine shone in
her bright eyes and glowed in her softly rounded
cheeks. Her hand was little and pointed, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
fitted like Berrie&#8217;s for tightening a cinch or
wielding an ax, and as he said &#8220;Good-by,&#8221;
he added: &#8220;I hope I shall see you again soon,&#8221;
and at the moment he meant it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll return to the Springs in a few days,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;Come and see us. Our bungalow
is on the other side of the river&mdash;and you, too,&#8221;
she addressed Berrie; but her tone was so conventionally
polite that the ranch-girl, burning
with jealous heat, made no reply.</p>
<p>McFarlane led the way to the lake rapidly
and in silence. The splendors of the foliage, subdued
by the rains, the grandeur of the peaks, the
song of the glorious stream&mdash;all were lost on
Berrie, for she now felt herself to be nothing but
a big, clumsy, coarse-handed tomboy. Her
worn gloves, her faded skirt, and her man&#8217;s shoes
had been made hateful to her by that smug,
graceful, play-acting tourist with the cool, keen
eyes and smirking lips. &#8220;She pretends to be a
kitten; but she isn&#8217;t; she&#8217;s a sly grown-up cat,&#8221;
she bitterly accused, but she could not deny the
charm of her personality.</p>
<p>Wayland was forced to acknowledge that Berrie
in this dark mood was not the delightful companion
she had hitherto been. Something sweet
and confiding had gone out of their relationship,
and he was too keen-witted not to know what it
was. He estimated precisely the value of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
malicious parting words of Siona Moore. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a natural tease, the kind of woman who loves to
torment other and less fortunate women. She
cares nothing for me, of course, it&#8217;s just her way
of paying off old scores. It would seem that
Berrie has not encouraged her advances in times
past.&#8221;</p>
<p>That Berrie was suffering, and that her jealousy
touchingly proved the depth of her love for him,
brought no elation, only perplexity. He was not
seeking such devotion. As a companion on the
trail she had been a joy&mdash;as a jealous sweetheart
she was less admirable. He realized perfectly that
this return journey was of her arrangement, not
McFarlane&#8217;s, and while he was not resentful of
her care, he was in doubt of the outcome. It
hurried him into a further intimacy which might
prove embarrassing.</p>
<p>At the camp by the lake the Supervisor became
sharply commanding. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s throw
these packs on lively. It will be slippery on the
high trail, and you&#8217;ll just naturally have to hit
leather hard and keep jouncing if you reach the
wagon-road before dark. But you&#8217;ll make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it!&#8221; said Berrie. &#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll
make it. Don&#8217;t you worry about that for a
minute. Once I get out of the green timber the
dark won&#8217;t worry me. We&#8217;ll push right through.&#8221;</p>
<p>In packing the camp stuff on the saddles,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
Berrie, almost as swift and powerful as her
father, acted with perfect understanding of every
task, and Wayland&#8217;s admiration of her skill increased
mightily.</p>
<p>She insisted on her father&#8217;s turning back. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t need you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can find the pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane&#8217;s faith in his daughter had been
tested many times, and yet he was a little loath
to have her start off on a trail new to her. He
argued against it briefly, but she laughed at his
fears. &#8220;I can go anywhere you can,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Stand clear!&#8221; With final admonition he stood
clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to keep off the boggy meadows,&#8221;
he warned; &#8220;these rains will have softened all
those muck-holes on the other side; they&#8217;ll be
bottomless pits; watch out for &#8217;em. Good-by!
If you meet Nash hurry him along. Moore is
anxious to run those lines. Keep in touch with
Landon, and if anybody turns up from the district
office say I&#8217;ll be back on Friday. Good
luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same to you. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berea led the way, and Norcross fell in behind
the pack-horses, feeling as unimportant as a small
boy at the heels of a circus parade. His girl
captain was so competent, so self-reliant, and so
sure that nothing he could say or do assisted in
the slightest degree. Her leadership was a curiously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
close reproduction of her father&#8217;s unhurried
and graceful action. Her seat in the saddle was
as easy as Landon&#8217;s, and her eyes were alert to
every rock and stream in the road. She was at
home here, where the other girl would have been
a bewildered child, and his words of praise lifted
the shadow from her face.</p>
<p>The sky was cloudy, and a delicious feeling of
autumn was in the air&mdash;autumn that might turn
to winter with a passing cloud, and the forest
was dankly gloomy and grimly silent, save from
the roaring stream which ran at times foam-white
with speed. The high peaks, gray and
streaked with new-fallen snow, shone grandly,
bleakly through the firs. The radiant beauty of
the road from the Springs, the golden glow of
four days before was utterly gone, and yet there
was exultation in this ride. A distinct pleasure,
a delight of another sort, lay in thus daring the
majesty of an unknown wind-swept pass.</p>
<p>Wayland called out: &#8220;The air feels like
Thanksgiving morning, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> Thanksgiving for me, and I&#8217;m going to
get a grouse for dinner,&#8221; she replied; and in less
than an hour the snap of her rifle made good her
promise.</p>
<p>After leaving the upper lake she turned to the
right and followed the course of a swift and
splendid stream, which came churning through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
a cheerless, mossy swamp of spruce-trees. Inexperienced
as he was, Wayland knew that this
was not a well-marked trail; but his confidence
in his guide was too great to permit of any worry
over the pass, and he amused himself by watching
the water-robins as they flitted from stone to
stone in the torrent, and in calculating just where
he would drop a line for trout if he had time to
do so, and in recovered serenity enjoyed his ride.
Gradually he put aside his perplexities concerning
the future, permitting his mind to prefigure
nothing but his duties with Landon at Meeker&#8217;s
Mill.</p>
<p>He was rather glad of the decision to send him
there, for it promised absorbing sport. &#8220;I shall
see how Landon and Belden work out their problem,&#8221;
he said. He had no fear of Frank Meeker
now. &#8220;As a forest guard with official duties to
perform I can meet that young savage on other
and more nearly equal terms,&#8221; he assured himself.</p>
<p>The trail grew slippery and in places ran full
of water. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a bottom, somewhere,&#8221;
Berrie confidently declared, and pushed ahead
with resolute mien. It was noon when they rose
above timber and entered upon the wide, smooth
slopes of the pass. Snow filled the grass here,
and the wind, keen, cutting, unhindered, came
out of the desolate west with savage fury; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
the sun occasionally shone through the clouds
with vivid splendor. &#8220;It is December now,&#8221;
shouted Wayland, as he put on his slicker and
cowered low to his saddle. &#8220;It will be January
soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will make it Christmas dinner,&#8221; she
laughed, and her glowing good humor warmed
his heart. She was entirely her cheerful self
again.</p>
<p>As they rose, the view became magnificent,
wintry, sparkling. The great clouds, drifting
like ancient warships heavy with armament,
sent down chill showers of hail over the frosted
gold of the grassy slopes; but when the shadows
passed the sunlight descended in silent cataracts
deliriously spring-like. The conies squeaked
from the rocky ridges, and a brace of eagles
circling about a lone crag, as if exulting in their
sovereign mastery of the air, screamed in shrill
ecstatic duo. The sheer cliffs, on their shadowed
sides, were violently purple. Everywhere the
landscape exhibited crashing contrasts of primary
pigments which bit into consciousness like
the flare of a martial band.</p>
<p>The youth would have lingered in spite of the
cold; but the girl kept steadily on, knowing well
that the hardest part of their journey was still
before them, and he, though longing to ride by
her side, and to enjoy the views with her, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
forced to remain in the rear in order to hurry the
reluctant pack-animals forward. They had now
reached a point twelve thousand feet above the
sea, and range beyond range, to the west and
south, rose into sight like stupendous waves of
a purple-green sea. To the east the park lay
level as a floor and carpeted in tawny velvet.</p>
<p>It was nearly two o&#8217;clock when they began to
drop down behind the rocky ridges of the eastern
slope, and soon, in the bottom of a warm and
sheltered hollow just at timber-line, Berrie drew
her horse to a stand and slipped from the saddle.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll rest here an hour,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and cook
our grouse; or are you too hungry to wait?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can wait,&#8221; he answered, dramatically.
&#8220;But it seems as if I had never eaten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, we&#8217;ll save the grouse till to-morrow;
but I&#8217;ll make some coffee. You bring
some water while I start a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, while the tired horses cropped the russet
grass, she boiled some coffee and laid out
some bread and meat, while he sat by watching
her and absorbing the beauty of the scene, the
charm of the hour. &#8220;It is exactly like a warm
afternoon in April,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and here are some
of the spring flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, sit by and eat,&#8221; she said, with
humor; and in perfectly restored tranquillity
they ate and drank, with no thought of critics
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
or of rivals. They were alone, and content to
be so.</p>
<p>It was deliciously sweet and restful there in
that sunny hollow on the breast of the mountain.
The wind swept through the worn branches of
the dwarfed spruce with immemorial wistfulness;
but these young souls heard it only as a far-off
song. Side by side on the soft Alpine clover
they rested and talked, looking away at the shining
peaks, and down over the dark-green billows
of fir beneath them. Half the forest was under
their eyes at the moment, and the man said:
&#8220;Is it not magnificent! It makes me proud of
my country. Just think, all this glorious spread
of hill and valley is under your father&#8217;s direction.
I may say under <i>your</i> direction, for I notice
he does just about what you tell him to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve noticed that?&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;If I
were a man I&#8217;d rather be Supervisor of this forest
than Congressman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Nash says you
<i>are</i> the Supervisor. I wonder if your father realizes
how efficient you are? Does he ever sorrow
over your not being a boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes shone with mirth. &#8220;Not that I can
notice. He &#8217;pears contented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good deal like a son to him, I
imagine. You can do about all that a boy can do,
anyhow&mdash;more than I could ever do. Does he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
realize how much you have to do with the management
of his forest? I&#8217;ve never seen your like.
I really believe you <i>could</i> carry on the work as
well as he.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed with pleasure. &#8220;You seem to
think I&#8217;m a district forester in disguise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have eyes, Miss Supervisor, and also ears&mdash;which
leads me to ask: Why don&#8217;t you clean out
that saloon gang? Landon is sure there&#8217;s crooked
work going on at that mill&mdash;certainly that open
bar is a disgraceful and corrupting thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face clouded. &#8220;We&#8217;ve tried to cut out
that saloon, but it can&#8217;t be done. You see, it&#8217;s
on a patented claim&mdash;the claim was bogus, of
course, and we&#8217;ve made complaint, but the matter
is hung up, and that gives &#8217;em a chance to
go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s not talk of that. It&#8217;s too delicious
an hour for any question of business. It is a
moment for poetry. I wish I could write what
I feel this moment. Why don&#8217;t we camp here
and watch the sun go down and the moon rise?
From our lofty vantage-ground the coming of
dawn would be an epic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t think of that,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;We must be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. The hour is too perfect. It may
never come again. The wind in the pines, the
sunshine, the conies crying from their rocks, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
butterflies on the clover&mdash;my heart aches with the
beauty of it. It&#8217;s been a wonderful trip. Even
that staggering walk in the rain had its splendid
quality. I couldn&#8217;t see the poetry in it then;
but I do now. These few days have made us
comrades, haven&#8217;t they&mdash;comrades of the trail?
You have been very considerate of me.&#8221; He took
her hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such hands. They
are like steel, and yet they are feminine.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew her hands away. &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of
my hands&mdash;they are so big and rough and dingy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re brown, of course, and calloused&mdash;a
little&mdash;but they are not big, and they are beautifully
modeled.&#8221; He looked at her speculatively.
&#8220;I am wondering how you would look in conventional
dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;&#8221; She hesitated. &#8220;I&#8217;d look
like a gawk in one of those low-necked outfits.
I&#8217;d never dare&mdash;and those tight skirts would
sure cripple me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, they wouldn&#8217;t. You&#8217;d have to modify
your stride a little; but you&#8217;d negotiate it.
You&#8217;re equal to anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making fun of me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m in earnest. You&#8217;re the
kind of American girl that can go anywhere and
do anything. My sisters would mortgage their
share of the golden streets for your abounding
health&mdash;and so would I.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are all right now,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t look or talk as you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this sunlight.&#8221; He lifted a spread hand
as if to clutch and hold something. &#8220;I feel it
soaking into me like some magical oil. No more
moping and whining for me. I&#8217;ve proved that
hardship is good for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t crow till you&#8217;re out of the woods. It&#8217;s
a long ride down the hill, and going down is harder
on the tenderfoot than going up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no longer a tenderfoot. All I need is
another trip like this with you and I shall be a
master trailer.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this was very sweet to her, and though she
knew they should be going, she lingered. Childishly
reckless of the sinking sun, she played with
the wild flowers at her side and listened to his
voice in complete content. He was right. The
hour was too beautiful to be shortened, although
she saw no reason why others equally delightful
might not come to them both. He was more of
the lover than he had ever been before, that she
knew, and in the light of his eyes all that was not
girlish and charming melted away. She forgot
her heavy shoes, her rough hands and sun-tanned
face, and listened with wondering joy and pride
to his words, which were of a fineness such as she
had never heard spoken&mdash;only books contained
such unusual and exquisite phrases.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>A cloud passing across the sun flung down a
shadow of portentous chill and darkness. She
started to her feet with startled recollection of
the place and the hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We <i>must</i> be going&mdash;at once!&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a cloud.
The sun is coming out again. I have perfect
confidence in your woodcraft. Why not spend
another night on the trail? It may be our last
trip together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tempted her strongly, so frank and boyish
and lovable were his glances and his words. But
she was vaguely afraid of herself, and though the
long ride at the moment seemed hard and dull,
the thought of her mother waiting decided her
action.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she responded, firmly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
wasted too much time already. We must ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up at her with challenging glance.
&#8220;Suppose I refuse&mdash;suppose I decide to stay
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon her, as he talked, a sweet hesitation fell,
a dream which held more of happiness than she
had ever known. &#8220;It is a long, hard ride,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;and another night on the trail will not
matter.&#8221; And so the moments passed on velvet
feet, and still she lingered, reluctant to break
the spell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, into their idyllic drowse of content,
so sweet, so youthful, and so pure of heart,
broke the sound of a horse&#8217;s hurrying, clashing,
steel-shod feet, and looking up Berrie saw a
mounted man coming down the mountainside
with furious, reckless haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Cliff!&#8221; she cried out. &#8220;He&#8217;s on our
trail!&#8221; And into her face came a look of alarm.
Her lips paled, her eyes widened. &#8220;He&#8217;s mad&mdash;he&#8217;s
dangerous! Leave him to me,&#8221; she added,
in a low, tense voice.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>THE DEATH-GRAPPLE</h3>
</div>

<p>There was something so sinister in the
rider&#8217;s disregard of stone and tree and
pace, something so menacing in the forward
thrust of his body, that Berrie was able to divine
his wrath, and was smitten into irresolution&mdash;all
her hardy, boyish self-reliance swallowed up in
the weakness of the woman. She forgot the
pistol at her belt, and awaited the assault with
rigid pose.</p>
<p>As Belden neared them Norcross also perceived
that the rider&#8217;s face was distorted with passion,
and that his glance was not directed upon Berrie,
but upon himself, and he braced himself for the
attack.</p>
<p>Leaving his saddle with one flying leap, which
the cowboy practises at play, Belden hurled himself
upon his rival with the fury of a panther.</p>
<p>The slender youth went down before the big
rancher as though struck by a catapult; and
the force of his fall against the stony earth
stunned him so that he lay beneath his enemy
as helpless as a child.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

THE SLENDER YOUTH WENT DOWN BEFORE THE BIG RANCHER AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A CATAPULT<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Belden snarled between his teeth: &#8220;I told you
I&#8217;d kill you, and I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this was not to be. Berea suddenly recovered
her native force. With a cry of pain,
of anger, she flung herself on the maddened
man&#8217;s back. Her hands encircled his neck like
a collar of bronze. Hardened by incessant use
of the cinch and the rope, her fingers sank into
the sinews of his great throat, shutting off both
blood and breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; she commanded, with deadly intensity.
&#8220;Let go, or I&#8217;ll choke the life out of
you! Let go, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised a hand to beat her off, but she was
too strong, too desperate to be driven away.
She was as blind to pain as a mother eagle, and
bent above him so closely that he could not
bring the full weight of his fist to bear. With
one determined hand still clutching his throat,
she ran the fingers of her other hand into his
hair and twisted his head upward with a power
which he could not resist. And so, looking into
his upturned, ferocious eyes, she repeated with
remorseless fury: &#8220;<i>Let go</i>, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>His swollen face grew rigid, his mouth gaped,
his tongue protruded, and at last, releasing his
hold on his victim, he rose, flinging Berrie off
with a final desperate effort. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you, too!&#8221;
he gasped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Up to this moment the girl had felt no fear of
herself; but now she resorted to other weapons.
Snatching her pistol from its holster, she leveled
it at his forehead. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; she said; and something
in her voice froze him into calm. He was
not a fiend; he was not a deliberate assassin;
he was only a jealous, despairing, insane lover,
and as he looked into the face he knew so well,
and realized that nothing but hate and deadly
resolution lit the eyes he had so often kissed, his
heart gave way, and, dropping his head, he
said: &#8220;Kill me if you want to. I&#8217;ve nothing
left to live for.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something unreal, appalling in this
sudden reversion to weakness, and Berrie could
not credit his remorse. &#8220;Give me your gun,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>He surrendered it to her and she threw it
aside; then turned to Wayland, who was lying
white and still with face upturned to the sky.
With a moan of anguish she bent above him and
called upon his name. He did not stir, and
when she lifted his head to her lap his hair,
streaming with blood, stained her dress. She
kissed him and called again to him, then turned
with accusing frenzy to Belden: &#8220;You&#8217;ve killed
him! Do you hear? You&#8217;ve killed him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The agony, the fury of hate in her voice
reached the heart of the conquered man. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
raised his head and stared at her with mingled
fear and remorse. And so across that limp body
these two souls, so lately lovers, looked into each
other&#8217;s eyes as though nothing but words of hate
and loathing had ever passed between them.
The girl saw in him only a savage, vengeful,
bloodthirsty beast; the man confronted in her
an accusing angel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to kill him,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did! You meant it. You crushed
his life out with your big hands&mdash;and now I&#8217;m
going to kill you for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>A fierce calm had come upon her. Some far-off
ancestral deep of passion called for blood
revenge. She lifted the weapon with steady
hand and pointed it at his heart.</p>
<p>His fear passed as his wrath had passed. His
head drooped, his glance wavered. &#8220;Shoot!&#8221; he
commanded, sullenly. &#8220;I&#8217;d sooner die than
live&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His words, his tone, brought back to her a
vision of the man he had seemed when she first
met and admired him. Her hand fell, the woman
in her reasserted itself. A wave of weakness, of
indecision, of passionate grief overwhelmed her.
&#8220;Oh, Cliff!&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;Why did you do it?
He was so gentle and sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not answer. His glance wandered to
his horse, serenely cropping the grass in utter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
disregard of this tumultuous human drama; but
the wind, less insensate than the brute, swept
through the grove of dwarfed, distorted pines
with a desolate, sympathetic moan which filled
the man&#8217;s heart with a new and exalted sorrow.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was crazy. I deserve
killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Berrie was now too deep in her own desolation
to care what he said or did. She kissed
the cold lips of the still youth, murmuring passionately:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to live without you&mdash;I
shall go with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Belden&#8217;s hand was on her wrist before she
could raise her weapon. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, for God&#8217;s sake,
don&#8217;t do that! He may not be dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>She responded but dully to the suggestion.
&#8220;No, no. He&#8217;s gone. His breath is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not. Let me see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she bent to the quiet face on which the
sunlight fell with mocking splendor. It seemed
all a dream till she felt once more the stain of
his blood upon her hands. It was all so incredibly
sudden. Only just now he was exulting
over the warmth and beauty of the day&mdash;and
now&mdash;</p>
<p>How beautiful he was. He seemed asleep.
The conies crying from their runways suddenly
took on poignant pathos. They appeared to be
grieving with her; but the eagles spoke of revenge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>A sharp cry, a note of joy sprang from her
lips. &#8220;He <i>is</i> alive! I saw his eyelids quiver&mdash;quick!
Bring some water.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man leaped to his feet, and, running down
to the pool, filled his sombrero with icy water.
He was as eager now to save his rival as he had
been mad to destroy him. &#8220;Let me help,&#8221; he
pleaded. But she would not permit him to
touch the body.</p>
<p>Again, while splashing the water upon his
face, the girl called upon her love to return.
&#8220;He hears me!&#8221; she exulted to her enemy. &#8220;He
is breathing now. He is opening his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded man did, indeed, open his eyes,
but his look was a blank, uncomprehending stare,
which plunged her back into despair. &#8220;He don&#8217;t
know me!&#8221; she said, with piteous accent. She
now perceived the source of the blood upon her
arm. It came from a wound in the boy&#8217;s head
which had been dashed upon a stone.</p>
<p>The sight of this wound brought back the
blaze of accusing anger to her eyes. &#8220;See what
you did!&#8221; she said, with cold malignity. Then
by sudden shift she bent to the sweet face in her
arms and kissed it passionately. &#8220;Open your
eyes, darling. You must not die! I won&#8217;t let
you die! Can&#8217;t you hear me? Don&#8217;t you know
where you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened his eyes once more, quietly, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
looked up into her face with a faint, drowsy
smile. He could not yet locate himself in space
and time, but he knew her and was comforted.
He wondered why he should be looking up into
a sunny sky. He heard the wind and the sound
of a horse cropping grass, and the voice of the
girl penetratingly sweet as that of a young
mother calling her baby back to life, and slowly
his benumbed brain began to resolve the mystery.</p>
<p>Belden, forgotten, ignored as completely as the
conies, sat with choking throat and smarting eyes.
For him the world was only dust and ashes&mdash;a
ruin which his own barbaric spirit had brought
upon itself.</p>
<p>Slowly the youth&#8217;s eyes took on expression.
&#8220;Are we still on the hill?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dearest,&#8221; she assured him. Then to
Belden, &#8220;He knows where he is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland again struggled with reality. &#8220;What
has happened to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fell and hurt your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned slightly and observed the other man
looking down at her with dark and tragic glance.
&#8220;Hello, Belden,&#8221; he said, feebly. &#8220;How came
you here?&#8221; Then noting Berrie&#8217;s look, he added:
&#8220;I remember. He tried to kill me.&#8221; He again
searched his antagonist&#8217;s face. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you finish the job?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl tried to turn his thought aside. &#8220;It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
all right now, darling. He won&#8217;t make any
more trouble. Don&#8217;t mind him. I don&#8217;t care
for anybody now you are coming back to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland wonderingly regarded the face of the
girl. &#8220;And you&mdash;are you hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not hurt. I am perfectly happy
now.&#8221; She turned to Belden with quick, authoritative
command. &#8220;Unsaddle the horses
and set up the tent. We won&#8217;t be able to leave
here to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose with instant obedience, glad of a
chance to serve her, and soon had the tent
pegged to its place and the bedding unrolled.
Together they lifted the wounded youth and
laid him upon his blankets beneath the low canvas
roof which seemed heavenly helpful to Berea.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said, caressingly. &#8220;Now you
are safe, no matter whether it rains or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;It seems I&#8217;m to have my way
after all. I hope I shall be able to see the sun
rise. I&#8217;ve sort of lost my interest in the sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Cliff,&#8221; she said, as soon as the camp
was in order and a fire started, &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;d
better ride on. I haven&#8217;t any further use for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Berrie,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t leave you here alone with a sick man. Let
me stay and help.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>She looked at him for a long time before she
replied. &#8220;I shall never be able to look at you
again without hating you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shall
always remember you as you looked when you
were killing that boy. So you&#8217;d better ride on
and keep a-riding. I&#8217;m going to forget all this
just as soon as I can, and it don&#8217;t help me any
to have you around. I never want to see you
or hear your name again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that, Berrie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she asserted, bitterly. &#8220;I mean
just that. So saddle up and pull out. All I
ask of you is to say nothing about what has happened
here. You&#8217;d better leave the state. If
Wayland should get worse it might go hard
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He accepted his banishment. &#8220;All right. If
you feel that way I&#8217;ll ride. But I&#8217;d like to do
something for you before I go. I&#8217;ll pile up some
wood&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ll take care of that.&#8221; And without
another word of farewell she turned away and
re-entered the tent.</p>
<p>Mounting his horse with painful slowness, as
though suddenly grown old, the reprieved assassin
rode away up the mountain, his head
low, his eyes upon the ground.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>BERRIE&#8217;S VIGIL</h3>
</div>

<p>The situation in which Berea now found herself
would have disheartened most women of
mature age, but she remained not only composed,
she was filled with an irrational delight. The
nurse that is in every woman was aroused in her,
and she looked forward with joy to a night of
vigil, confident that Wayland was not seriously
injured and that he would soon be able to ride.
She had no fear of the forest or of the night.
Nature held no menace now that her tent was
set and her fire alight.</p>
<p>Wayland, without really knowing anything
about it, suspected that he owed his life to her
intervention, and this belief deepened the feeling
of admiration which he had hitherto felt
toward her. He listened to her at work around
the fire with a deepening sense of his indebtedness
to her, and when she looked in to ask if she
could do anything for him, his throat filled with
an emotion which rendered his answer difficult.</p>
<p>As his mind cleared he became very curious
to know precisely what had taken place, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
did not feel free to ask her. &#8220;She will tell me
if she wishes me to know.&#8221; That she had vanquished
Belden and sent him on his way was
evident, although he had not been able to hear
what she had said to him at the last. What lay
between the enemy&#8217;s furious onslaught and the
aid he lent in making the camp could only be
surmised. &#8220;I wonder if she used her pistol?&#8221;
Wayland asked himself. &#8220;Something like death
must have stared him in the face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange how everything seems to throw me
ever deeper into her debt,&#8221; he thought, a little
later. But he did not quite dare put into words
the resentment which mingled with his gratitude.
He hated to be put so constantly into the
position of the one protected, defended. And
yet it was his own fault. He had put himself
among people and conditions where she was the
stronger. Having ventured out of his world into
hers he must take the consequences.</p>
<p>That she loved him with the complete passion
of her powerful and simple nature he knew, for
her voice had reached through the daze of his
semi-unconsciousness with thrilling power. The
touch of her lips to his, the close clasp of her
strong arms were of ever greater convincing
quality. And yet he wished the revelation had
come in some other way. His pride was abraded.
His manhood seemed somehow lessened. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
a disconcerting reversal of the ordinary relations
between hero and heroine, and he saw no way
of re-establishing the normal attitude of the male.</p>
<p>Entirely unaware of what was passing in the
mind of her patient, Berrie went about her
duties with a cheerfulness which astonished the
sufferer in the tent. She seemed about to hum
a song as she set the skillet on the fire, but a
moment later she called out, in a tone of irritation:
&#8220;Here comes Nash!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; answered Wayland, although
he perceived something of her displeasure.</p>
<p>Nash, on his way to join the Supervisor, raised
a friendly greeting as he saw the girl, and drew
rein. &#8220;I expected to meet you farther down
the hill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tony &#8217;phoned that you had
started. Where did you leave the Supervisor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over at the station waiting for you. Where&#8217;s
your outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Camped down the trail a mile or so. I
thought I&#8217;d better push through to-night. What
about Norcross? Isn&#8217;t he with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated an instant. &#8220;He&#8217;s in the tent.
He fell and struck his head on a rock, and I had
to go into camp here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash was deeply concerned. &#8220;Is that so?
Well, that&#8217;s hard luck. Is he badly hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he had a terrible fall. But he&#8217;s easier
now. I think he&#8217;s asleep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;May I look in on him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d better take the time.
It&#8217;s a long, hard ride from here to the station.
It will be deep night before you can make it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the Supervisor would want
me to camp here to-night and do what I could
for you? If Norcross is badly injured you will
need me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She liked Nash, and she knew he was right,
and yet she was reluctant to give up the pleasure
of her lone vigil. &#8220;He&#8217;s not in any danger, and
we&#8217;ll be able to ride on in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash, thinking of her as Clifford Belden&#8217;s
promised wife, had no suspicion of her feeling
toward Norcross. Therefore he gently urged
that to go on was quite out of order. &#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i>
think of leaving you here alone&mdash;certainly not
till I see Norcross and find out how badly he is
hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>She yielded. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re right,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go see if he is awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her to the door of the tent, apprehending
something new and inexplicable in her
attitude. In the music of her voice as she spoke
to the sick man was the love-note of the mate.
&#8220;You may come in,&#8221; she called back, and Nash,
stooping, entered the small tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, old man, what you been doing with
yourself? Hitting the high spots?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Norcross smiled feebly. &#8220;No, the hill flew
up and bumped <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it all happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know. It all came of a sudden.
I had no share in it&mdash;I didn&#8217;t go for to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you did or not, you seem to have
made a good job of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash examined the wounded man carefully,
and his skill and strength in handling Norcross
pleased Berrie, though she was jealous of the
warm friendship which seemed to exist between
the men.</p>
<p>She had always liked Nash, but she resented
him now, especially as he insisted on taking
charge of the case; but she gave way finally,
and went back to her pots and pans with pensive
countenance.</p>
<p>A little later, when Nash came out to make report,
she was not very gracious in her manner.
&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty badly hurt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s an
ugly gash in his scalp, and the shock has produced
a good deal of pain and confusion in his
head; but he&#8217;s going to be all right in a day or
two. For a man seeking rest and recuperation
he certainly has had a tough run of weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though a serious-minded, honorable forester,
determined to keep sternly in mind that he was
in the presence of the daughter of his chief, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
that she was engaged to marry another, Nash
was, after all, a man, and the witchery of the
hour, the charm of the girl&#8217;s graceful figure,
asserted their power over him. His eyes grew
tender, and his voice eloquent in spite of himself.
His words he could guard, but it was hard
to keep from his speech the song of the lover.
The thought that he was to camp in her company,
to help her about the fire, to see her from
moment to moment, with full liberty to speak
to her, to meet her glance, pleased him. It was
the most romantic and moving episode in his
life, and though of a rather dry and analytic
temperament he had a sense of poesy.</p>
<p>The night, black, oppressive, and silent, brought
a closer bond of mutual help and understanding
between them. He built a fire of dry branches
close to the tent door, and there sat, side by side
with the girl, in the glow of embers, so close to
the injured youth that they could talk together,
and as he spoke freely, yet modestly, of his experiences
Berrie found him more deeply interesting
than she had hitherto believed him to be.
True, he saw things less poetically than Wayland,
but he was finely observant, and a man of
studious and refined habits.</p>
<p>She grew friendlier, and asked him about his
work, and especially about his ambitions and
plans for the future. They discussed the forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and its enemies, and he wondered at her freedom
in speaking of the Mill and saloon. He said:
&#8220;Of course you know that Alec Belden is a
partner in that business, and I&#8217;m told&mdash;of course
I don&#8217;t know this&mdash;that Clifford Belden is also
interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>She offered no defense of young Belden, and
this unconcern puzzled him. He had expected
indignant protest, but she merely replied: &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care who owns it. It should be rooted out.
I hate that kind of thing. It&#8217;s just another way
of robbing those poor tie-jacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clifford should get out of it. Can&#8217;t you persuade
him to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His relationship to you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not related to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tone amazed him. &#8220;You know what I
mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do, but you&#8217;re mistaken. We&#8217;re
not related that way any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>This silenced him for a few moments, then he
said: &#8220;I&#8217;m rather glad of that. He isn&#8217;t anything
like the man you thought he was&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t say these things before&mdash;but he is as
greedy as Alec, only not so open about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this comment, which moved the forester
so deeply to utter, seemed not to interest Berea.
She sat staring at the fire with the calm brow of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
an Indian. Clifford Belden had passed out of
her life as completely as he had vanished out
of the landscape. She felt an immense relief at
being rid of him, and resented his being brought
back even as a subject of conversation.</p>
<p>Wayland, listening, fancied he understood her
desire, and said nothing that might arouse
Nash&#8217;s curiosity.</p>
<p>Nash, on his part, knowing that she had
broken with Belden, began to understand the
tenderness, the anxious care of her face and
voice, as she bent above young Norcross. As
the night deepened and the cold air stung, he
asked: &#8220;Have you plenty of blankets for a bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t intend
to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Go to bed.
I will keep the fire going.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last she consented. &#8220;I will make my bed
right here at the mouth of the tent close to the
fire,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and you can call me if you
need me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not put your bed in the tent? It&#8217;s
going to be cold up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all right outside,&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your bed inside, Miss Berrie. We can&#8217;t
let conventions count above timber-line. I
shall rest better if I know you are properly
sheltered.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>And so it happened that for the third time she
shared the same roof with her lover; but the
nurse was uppermost in her now. At eleven
thousand feet above the sea&mdash;with a cold drizzle
of fine rain in the air&mdash;one does not consider the
course of gossip as carefully as in a village, and
Berrie slept unbrokenly till daylight.</p>
<p>Nash was the first to arise in the dusk of dawn,
and Berrie, awakened by the crackle of his fire,
soon joined him. There is no sweeter sound
than the voice of the flame at such a time, in
such a place. It endows the bleak mountainside
with comfort, makes the ledge a hearthstone.
It holds the promise of savory meats and fragrant
liquor, and robs the frosty air of its terrors.</p>
<p>Wayland, hearing their voices, called out,
with feeble humor: &#8220;Will some one please turn
on the steam in my room?&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie uttered a happy word. &#8220;How do you
feel this morning?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not precisely like a pugilist&mdash;well, yes, I believe
I do&mdash;like the fellow who got second money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the bump?&#8221; inquired Nash, thrusting
his head inside the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reduced to the size of a golf-ball as near as
I can judge of it. I doubt if I can wear a hat;
but I&#8217;m feeling fine. I&#8217;m going to get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie was greatly relieved. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!
Do you feel like riding down the hill?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing! I&#8217;m hungry, and as soon as I
am fed I&#8217;m ready to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie joined the surveyor at the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll round up our horses, Mr. Nash,
I&#8217;ll rustle breakfast and we&#8217;ll get going,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Nash, enthralled, lingered while she twisted
her hair into place, then went out to bring in
the ponies.</p>
<p>Wayland came out a little uncertainly, but
looking very well. &#8220;I think I shall discourage
my friends from coming to this region for their
health,&#8221; he said, ruefully. &#8220;If I were a novelist
now all this would be grist for my mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beneath his joking he was profoundly chagrined.
He had hoped by this time to be as
sinewy, as alert as Nash, instead of which here
he sat, shivering over the fire like a sick girl, his
head swollen, his blood sluggish; but this discouragement
only increased Berea&#8217;s tenderness&mdash;a
tenderness which melted all his reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worth all your care,&#8221; he said to her,
with poignant glance.</p>
<p>The sun rose clear and warm, and the fire,
the coffee, put new courage into him as well as
into the others, and while the morning was yet
early and the forest chill and damp with rain,
the surveyor brought up the horses and started
packing the outfit.</p>
<p>In this Berrie again took part, doing her half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
of the work quite as dextrously as Nash himself.
Indeed, the forester was noticeably confused
and not quite up to his usual level of adroit
ease.</p>
<p>At last both packs were on, and as they stood
together for a moment, Nash said: &#8220;This has
been a great experience&mdash;one I shall remember
as long as I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stirred uneasily under his frank admiration.
&#8220;I&#8217;m mightily obliged to you,&#8221; she replied,
as heartily as she could command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t thank me, I&#8217;m indebted to you. There
is so little in my life of such companionship as
you and Norcross give me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find it lonesome over at the station,
I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But Moore intends to
put a crew of tie-cutters in over there&mdash;that will
help some.&#8221; She smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not partial to the society of tie-jacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ride hard you may find that Moore
girl in camp. She was there when we left.&#8221;
There was a sparkle of mischief in her glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in the Moore girl,&#8221; he
retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen her at the post-office once or twice;
<i>she</i> is not my kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand. &#8220;Well, good-by.
I&#8217;m all right now that Wayland can ride.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>He held her hand an instant. &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll
ride back with you as far as the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go on. Father is waiting for
you. I&#8217;ll send the men along.&#8221; There was dismissal
in her voice, and yet she recognized as
never before the fine qualities that were his.
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say anything of this to others,
and tell my father not to worry about us. We&#8217;ll
pull in all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped Norcross mount his horse, and as
he put the lead rope into Berrie&#8217;s hand, he said:
with much feeling: &#8220;Good luck to you. I shall
remember this night all the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to be going to the rear,&#8221; called Wayland,
whose bare, bandaged head made him
look like a wounded young officer. &#8220;But I
guess it&#8217;s better for me to lay off for a week or
two and recover my tone.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so they parted, the surveyor riding his
determined way up the naked mountainside
toward the clouds, while Berrie and her ward
plunged at once into the dark and dripping
forest below. &#8220;If you can stand the grief,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll go clear through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland had his misgivings, but did not say
so. His confidence in his guide was complete.
She would do her part, that was certain. Several
times she was forced to dismount and blaze out
a new path in order to avoid some bog; but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
sternly refused his aid. &#8220;You must not get off,&#8221;
she warned; &#8220;stay where you are. I can do
this work better alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were again in that green, gloomy, and
silent zone of the range, where giant spruces grow,
and springs, oozing from the rocks, trickle over
the trail. It was very beautiful, but menacing,
by reason of its apparently endless thickets cut
by stony ridges. It was here she met the two
young men, Downing and Travis, bringing forward
the surveying outfit, but she paused only
to say: &#8220;Push along steadily. You are needed
on the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>After leaving the men, and with a knowledge
that the remaining leagues of the trail were
solitary, Norcross grew fearful. &#8220;The fall of a
horse, an accident to that brave girl, and we
would be helpless,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I wish Nash
had returned with us.&#8221; Once his blood chilled
with horror as he watched his guide striking out
across the marge of a grassy lake. This meadow,
as he divined, was really a carpet of sod floating
above a bottomless pool of muck, for it shook
beneath her horse&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she called back,
cheerily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon pick up the other trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wondered how she knew, for to him each
hill was precisely like another, each thicket a
maze.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Her caution was all for him. She tried each
dangerous slough first, and thus was able to advise
him which way was safest. His head throbbed
with pain and his knees were weary, but he rode
on, manifesting such cheer as he could, resolving
not to complain at any cost; but his self-respect
ebbed steadily, leaving him in bitter, silent dejection.</p>
<p>At last they came into open ground on a high
ridge, and were gladdened by the valley outspread
below them, for it was still radiant with
color, though not as brilliant as before the rain.
It had been dimmed, but not darkened. And
yet it seemed that a month had passed since
their ecstatic ride upward through the golden
forest, and Wayland said as much while they
stood for a moment surveying the majestic park
with its wall of guardian peaks.</p>
<p>But Berrie replied: &#8220;It seems only a few hours
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>From this point the traveling was good, and
they descended rapidly, zigzagging from side to
side of a long, sweeping ridge. By noon they
were once more down amid the aspens, basking
in a world of sad gold leaves and delicious
September sunshine.</p>
<p>At one o&#8217;clock, on the bank of a clear stream,
the girl halted. &#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d better camp
awhile. You look tired, and I am hungry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>He gratefully acquiesced in this stop, for
his knees were trembling with the strain of the
stirrups; but he would not permit her to ease
him down from his saddle. Turning a wan
glance upon her, he bitterly asked: &#8220;Must I
always play the weakling before you? I am
ashamed of myself. Ride on and leave me to
rot here in the grass. I&#8217;m not worth keeping
alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not talk like that,&#8221; she gently
admonished him. &#8220;You&#8217;re not to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. I should never have ventured
into this man&#8217;s country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did,&#8221; she answered, as if she
were comforting a child. &#8220;For if you hadn&#8217;t I
should never have known you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would have been no loss&mdash;to you,&#8221; he
bitterly responded.</p>
<p>She unsaddled one pack-animal and spread
some blankets on the grass. &#8220;Lie down and
rest while I boil some coffee,&#8221; she commanded;
and he obeyed, too tired to make pretension toward
assisting.</p>
<p>Lying so, feeling the magic of the sun, hearing
the music of the water, and watching the girl,
he regained a serener mood, and when she came
back with his food he thanked her for it with a
glance before which her eyes fell. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
why you are so kind to me, I really believe you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
<i>like</i> to do things for me.&#8221; Her head drooped to
hide her face, and he went on: &#8220;Why do you
care for me? Tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she murmured. Then she
added, with a flash of bravery: &#8220;But I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a mystery it all is! You turn from a
splendid fellow like Landon to a &#8216;skate&#8217; like me.
Landon worships you&mdash;you know that&mdash;don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;he&mdash;&#8221; she ended, vaguely distressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he ask you to marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you? He&#8217;s just the mate for
you. He&#8217;s a man of high character and education.&#8221;
She made no answer to this, and he
went on: &#8220;Dear girl, I&#8217;m not worth your care&mdash;truly
I&#8217;m not. I resented your engagement to
Belden, for he was a brute; but Landon is different.
He thinks the world of you. He&#8217;ll go high
in the service. I&#8217;ve never done anything in the
world&mdash;I never shall. It will be better for you
if I go&mdash;to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took his hand and pressed it to her cheek,
then, putting her arm about his neck, drew him
to her bosom and kissed him passionately. &#8220;You
break my heart when you talk like that,&#8221; she
protested, with tears. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say such
gloomy things&mdash;I won&#8217;t let you give up. You
shall come right home with me, and I will nurse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
you till you are well. It was all my fault. If
we had only stayed in camp at the lake daddy
would have joined us that night, and if I had
not loitered on the mountain yesterday Cliff
would not have overtaken us. It&#8217;s all my
fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not have it go that way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
brought you only care and unhappiness thus far.
I&#8217;m an alien&mdash;my ways are not your ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can change,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I hate my
ways, and I like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they argued she felt no shame, and he
voiced no resentment. She knew his mood.
She understood his doubt, his depression. She
pleaded as a man might have done, ready to
prove her love, eager to restore his self-respect,
while he remained both bitter and sadly contemptuous.</p>
<p>A cow-hand riding up the trail greeted Berrie
respectfully, but a cynical smile broke out on his
lips as he passed on. Another witness&mdash;another
gossip.</p>
<p>She did not care. She had no further concern
of the valley&#8217;s comment. Her life&#8217;s happiness
hung on the drooping eyelashes of this wounded
boy, and to win him back to cheerful acceptance
of life was her only concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had any motives,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always done what pleased me at the moment&mdash;or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
because it was easier to do as others
were doing. I went to college that way. Truth
is, I never had any surplus vitality, and my
father never demanded anything of me. I
haven&#8217;t any motives now. A few days ago I
was interested in forestry. At this time it all
seems futile. What&#8217;s the use of my trying to
live?&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of all this despairing cry arose from
weariness, and part from a luxurious desire to
be comforted, for it was sweet to feel her sympathy.
He even took a morbid pleasure in the
distress of her eyes and lips while her rich voice
murmured in soothing protest.</p>
<p>She, on her part, was frightened for him, and
as she thought of the long ride still before them
she wrung her hands. &#8220;Oh, what shall I do?
What shall I do?&#8221; she moaned.</p>
<p>Instantly smitten into shame, into manlier
mood, he said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, please
don&#8217;t. I can ride. I&#8217;m feeling better. You
must not weaken. Please forgive my selfish
complaints. I&#8217;m done! You&#8217;ll never hear it
again. Come, let us go on. I can ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can reach Miller&#8217;s ranch&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can ride to <i>your</i> ranch,&#8221; he declared, and
rose with such new-found resolution that she
stared at him in wonder.</p>
<p>He was able to smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
crying spell. I&#8217;ve relieved my heart of its load.
I didn&#8217;t mean to agonize you. It was only a
slump.&#8221; He put his hand to his head. &#8220;I must
be a comical figure. Wonder what that cowboy
thought of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>His sudden reversal to cheer was a little
alarming to her, but at length she perceived
that he had in truth mastered his depression,
and bringing up the horses she saddled them,
and helped him to mount. &#8220;If you get tired
or feel worse, tell me, and we&#8217;ll go into camp,&#8221;
she urged as they were about to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep going till I give the sign,&#8221; he replied;
and his voice was so firm and clear that
her own sunny smile came back. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what to make of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
reckon you must be a poet.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>THE GOSSIPS AWAKE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was dark when they reached the village, but
Wayland declared his ability to go on, although
his wounded head was throbbing with
fever and he was clinging to the pommel of his
saddle; so Berrie rode on.</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane, hearing the horses on the
bridge, was at the door and received her daughter
with wondering question, while the stable-hands,
quick to detect an injured man, hurried to lift
Norcross down from his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; repeated Mrs. McFarlane.</p>
<p>&#8220;He fell and struck his head on a stone,&#8221; Berea
hastily explained. &#8220;Take the horses, boys,
mother and I will look out for Mr. Norcross.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men obeyed her and fell back, but they
were consumed with curiosity, and their glances
irritated the girl. &#8220;Slip the packs at once,&#8221; she
insisted.</p>
<p>With instant sympathy her mother came to
her aid in supporting the wounded, weary youth
indoors, and as he stretched out on the couch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
in the sitting-room, he remarked, with a faint,
ironic smile: &#8220;This beats any bed of balsam
boughs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your father?&#8221; asked Mrs. McFarlane
of her daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s over on the Ptarmigan. I&#8217;ve a powerful
lot to tell you, mother; but not now; we
must look after Wayland. He&#8217;s nearly done up,
and so am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane winced a little at her daughter&#8217;s
use of Norcross&#8217;s first name, but she said nothing
further at the moment, although she watched
Berrie closely while she took off Wayland&#8217;s shoes
and stockings and rubbed his icy feet. &#8220;Get
him something hot as quick as you can!&#8221; she
commanded; and Mrs. McFarlane obeyed without
a word.</p>
<p>Gradually the tremor passed out of his limbs
and a delicious sense of warmth, of safety, stole
over him, and he closed his eyes in the comfort
of her presence and care. &#8220;Rigorous business
this life of the pioneer,&#8221; he said, with mocking
inflection. &#8220;I think I prefer a place in the
lumber trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk,&#8221; she said. Then, with a rush
of tender remorse: &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me to
stop? I didn&#8217;t realize that you were so tired.
We could have stopped at the Springs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how tired I was till I got here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Gee,&#8221; he said, boyishly, &#8220;that door-knob at the
back of my head is red-hot! You&#8217;re good to
me,&#8221; he added, humbly.</p>
<p>She hated to have him resume that tone of
self-depreciation, and, kneeling to him, she kissed
his cheek, and laid her head beside his. &#8220;You&#8217;re
splendid,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Nobody could be
braver; but you should have told me you were
exhausted. You fooled me with your cheerful
answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He accepted her loving praise, her clasping
arms, as a part of the rescue from the darkness
and pain of the long ride, careless of what it
might bring to him in the future. He ate his
toast and drank his coffee, and permitted the
women to lead him to his room, and then being
alone he crept into his bed and fell instantly
asleep.</p>
<p>Berrie and her mother went back to the sitting-room,
and Mrs. McFarlane closed the door behind
them. &#8220;Now tell me all about it,&#8221; she
said, in the tone of one not to be denied.</p>
<p>The story went along very smoothly till the
girl came to the second night in camp beside the
lake; there her voice faltered, and the reflective
look in the mother&#8217;s eyes deepened as she
learned that her daughter had shared her tent
with the young man. &#8220;It was the only thing
to do, mother,&#8221; Berrie bravely said. &#8220;It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
cold and wet outside, and you know he isn&#8217;t very
strong, and his teeth were chattering, he was so
chilled. I know it sounds strange down here;
but up there in the woods in the storm what I
did seemed right and natural. You know what
I mean, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand. I don&#8217;t blame you&mdash;only&mdash;if
others should hear of it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they won&#8217;t. No one knows of our being
alone there except Tony and father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure? Doesn&#8217;t Mrs. Belden know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so&mdash;not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane&#8217;s nervousness grew. &#8220;I wish
you hadn&#8217;t gone on this trip. If the Beldens find
out you were alone with Mr. Norcross they&#8217;ll
make much of it. It will give them a chance
at your father.&#8221; Her mind turned upon another
point. &#8220;When did Mr. Norcross get his
fall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the way back.&#8221; Here Berrie hesitated
again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to tell you, mother, but
he didn&#8217;t fall, Cliff jumped him and tried to
kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother doubted her ears. &#8220;Cliff did?
How did he happen to meet you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie was quick to answer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
how he found out we were on the trail. I suppose
the old lady &#8217;phoned him. Anyhow, while
we were camped for noon yesterday&#8221;&mdash;her face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
flamed again at thought of that tender, beautiful
moment when they were resting on the grass&mdash;&#8220;while
we were at our lunch he came tearing
down the hill on that big bay horse of his and
took a flying jump at Wayland. As Wayland
went down he struck his head on a stone. I
thought he was dead, and I was paralyzed for a
second. Then I flew at Cliff and just about
choked the life out of him. I&#8217;d have ended him
right there if he hadn&#8217;t let go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane, looking upon her daughter
in amazement, saw on her face the shadow of the
deadly rage which had burned in her heart as she
clenched young Belden&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What then? What happened then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He let go, you bet.&#8221; Her smile came back.
&#8220;And when he realized what he&#8217;d done&mdash;<i>he</i>
thought Wayland was dead&mdash;he began to weaken.
Then I took my gun and was all for putting an
end to him right there, when I saw Wayland&#8217;s
eyelids move. After that I didn&#8217;t care what became
of Cliff. I told him to ride on and keep
a-ridin&#8217;, and I reckon he&#8217;s clear out of the state
by this time. If he ever shows up I&#8217;ll put him
where he&#8217;ll have all night to be sorry in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did this take place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday about two. Of course Wayland
couldn&#8217;t ride, he was so dizzy and kind o&#8217; confused,
and so I went into camp right there at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
timber-line. Along about sunset Nash came
riding up from this side, and insisted on staying
to help me&mdash;so I let him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane&#8217;s tense attitude relaxed.
&#8220;Nash is not the kind that tattles. I&#8217;m glad he
turned up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this morning I saddled and came down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Nash go on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, daddy was waiting for him, so I sent
him along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all sad business,&#8221; groaned Mrs. McFarlane,
&#8220;and I can see you&#8217;re keeping something
back. How did Cliff happen to know just where
you were? And what started you back without
your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Berrie showed signs of
weakness and distress. &#8220;Why, you see, Alec
Belden and Mr. Moore were over there to look
at some timber, and old Marm Belden and that
Moore girl went along. I suppose they sent
word to Cliff, and I presume that Moore girl
put him on our trail. Leastwise that&#8217;s the way
I figure it out. That&#8217;s the worst of the whole
business.&#8221; She admitted this with darkened
brow. &#8220;Mrs. Belden&#8217;s tongue is hung in the
middle and loose at both ends&mdash;and that Moore
girl is spiteful mean.&#8221; She could not keep the
contempt out of her voice. &#8220;She saw us start
off, and she is sure to follow it up and find out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
what happened on the way home; even if they
don&#8217;t see Cliff they&#8217;ll <i>talk</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I <i>wish</i> you hadn&#8217;t gone!&#8221; exclaimed the
worried mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped now, and it hasn&#8217;t done
me any real harm. It&#8217;s all in the day&#8217;s work,
anyhow. I&#8217;ve always gone with daddy before,
and this trip isn&#8217;t going to spoil me. The boys
all know me, and they will treat me fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but Mr. Norcross is an outsider&mdash;a city
man. They will all think evil of him on that
account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know; that&#8217;s what troubles me. No one
will know how fine and considerate he was.
Mother, I&#8217;ve never known any one like him.
He&#8217;s a poet! He&#8217;s taught me to see things I
never saw before. Everything interests him&mdash;the
birds, the clouds, the voices in the fire. I
never was so happy in my life as I was during
those first two days, and that night in camp before
he began to worry&mdash;it was just wonderful.&#8221;
Words failed her, but her shining face and the
forward straining pose of her body enlightened
the mother. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what people say of
me if only they will be just to him. They&#8217;ve <i>got</i>
to treat him right,&#8221; she added, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he speak to you&mdash;are you engaged?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head drooped. &#8220;Not really engaged,
mother; but he told me how much he liked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
me&mdash;and&mdash;it&#8217;s all right, mother, I <i>know</i> it is. I&#8217;m
not fine enough for him, but I&#8217;m going to try to
change my ways so he won&#8217;t be ashamed of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane&#8217;s face cleared. &#8220;He surely is
a fine young fellow, and can be trusted to do the
right thing. Well, we might as well go to bed.
We can&#8217;t settle anything till your father gets
home,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Wayland rose next morning free from dizziness
and almost free from pain, and when he came
out of his room his expression was cheerful.
&#8220;I feel as if I&#8217;d slept a week, and I&#8217;m hungry.
I don&#8217;t know why I should be, but I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane met him with something very
intimate, something almost maternal in her look;
but her words were as few and as restrained as
ever. He divined that she had been talking with
Berrie, and that a fairly clear understanding of
the situation had been reached. That this understanding
involved him closely he was aware;
but nothing in his manner acknowledged it.</p>
<p>She did not ask any questions, believing
that sooner or later the whole story must come
out. The fact that Siona Moore and Mrs. Belden
knew that Berrie had started back on
Thursday with young Norcross made it easy for
the villagers to discover that she had not reached
the ranch till Saturday. &#8220;What could Joe have
been thinking of to allow them to go?&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
said. &#8220;Mr. Nash&#8217;s presence in the camp must
be made known; but then there is Clifford&#8217;s
assault upon Mr. Norcross, can that be kept
secret, too?&#8221; And so while the young people
chatted, the troubled mother waited in fear,
knowing that in a day or two the countryside
would be aflame with accusation.</p>
<p>In a landscape like this, as she well knew,
nothing moves unobserved. The native&mdash;man
or woman&mdash;is able to perceive and name objects
scarcely discernible to the eye of the alien. A
minute speck is discovered on the hillside.
&#8220;Hello, there&#8217;s Jim Sanders on his roan,&#8221; says
one, or &#8220;Here comes Kit Jenkins with her flea-bit
gray. I wonder who&#8217;s on the bay alongside
of her,&#8221; remarks another, and each of these
observations is taken quite as a matter of course.
With a wide and empty field of vision, and with
trained, unspoiled optic nerves, the plainsman is
marvelously penetrating of glance. Hence, Mrs.
McFarlane was perfectly certain that not one but
several of her neighbors had seen and recognized
Berrie and young Norcross as they came down
the hill. In a day or two every man would know
just where they camped, and what had taken
place in camp. Mrs. Belden would not rest till
she had ferreted out every crook and turn of
that trail, and her speech was quite as coarse
as that of any of her male associates.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>Easy-going with regard to many things, these
citizens were abnormally alive to all matters relating
to courtship, and popular as she believed
Berrie to be, Mrs. McFarlane could not hope
that her daughter would be spared&mdash;especially
by the Beldens, who would naturally feel that
Clifford had been cheated. She sighed deeply.
&#8220;Well, nothing can be done till Joe returns,&#8221; she
repeated.</p>
<p>A long day&#8217;s rest, a second night&#8217;s sleep, set
Wayland on his feet. He came to breakfast
quite gay. &#8220;Barring the hickory-nut on the
back of my head,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling
fine, almost ready for another expedition. I
may make a ranger yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie, though equally gay, was not so sure
of his ability to return to work. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;d
better go easy till daddy gets back; but if you
feel like it we&#8217;ll ride up to the post-office this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to start right in to learn to throw that
hitch, and I&#8217;m going to practise with an ax till
I can strike twice in the same place. This trip
was an eye-opener. Great man I&#8217;d be in a windfall&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
I?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was persuaded to remain very quiet for
another day, and part of it was spent in conversation
with Mrs. McFarlane&mdash;whom he liked
very much&mdash;and an hour or more in writing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
a long letter wherein he announced to his
father his intention of going into the Forest
Service. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to build up a constitution,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t know of a better place to
do it in. Besides, I&#8217;m beginning to be interested
in the scheme. I like the Supervisor. I&#8217;m living
in his house at the present time, and I&#8217;m
feeling contented and happy, so don&#8217;t worry
about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was indeed quite comfortable, save when
he realized that Mrs. McFarlane was taking altogether
too much for granted in their relationship.
It was delightful to be so watched over, so
waited upon, so instructed. &#8220;But where is it
all leading me?&#8221; he continued to ask himself&mdash;and
still that wall of reserve troubled and saddened
Berrie.</p>
<p>They expected McFarlane that night, and
waited supper for him, but he did not come, and
so they ate without him, and afterward Wayland
helped Berrie do up the dishes while the mother
bent above her sewing by the kitchen lamp.</p>
<p>There was something very sweet and gentle
about Mrs. McFarlane, and the exile took almost
as much pleasure in talking with her as with
her daughter. He led her to tell of her early
experiences in the valley, and of the strange
types of men and women with whom she had
crossed the range.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them are here yet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In
fact the most violent of all the opponents to
the Service are these old adventurers. I don&#8217;t
think they deserve to be called pioneers. They
never did any work in clearing the land or in
building homes. Some of them, who own big
herds of cattle, still live in dug-outs. They raged
at Mr. McFarlane for going into the Service&mdash;called
him a traitor. Old Jake Proudfoot was
especially furious&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should see where old Jake lives,&#8221; interrupted
Berrie. &#8220;He sleeps on the floor in one
corner of his cabin, and never changes his shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; warned Mrs. McFarlane.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the men all say. Daddy declares
if they were to scrape Jake they&#8217;d find at
least five layers of shirts. His wife left him
fifteen years ago, couldn&#8217;t stand his habits, and
he&#8217;s got worse ever since. Naturally he is opposed
to the Service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; her mother explained, &#8220;those
who oppose the Supervisor aren&#8217;t all like Jake;
but it makes me angry to have the papers all
quoting Jake as &#8216;one of the leading ranchers of
the valley.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not bring herself to take up the
most vital subject of all&mdash;the question of her
daughter&#8217;s future. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait till father gets
home,&#8221; she decided.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>On the fourth morning the &#8217;phone rang, and the
squawking voice of Mrs. Belden came over the
wire. &#8220;I wanted to know if Berrie and her
feller got home all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they arrived safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman chuckled. &#8220;Last I see of Cliff
he was hot on their trail&mdash;looked like he expected
to take a hand in that expedition. Did he overtake
&#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear very well&mdash;where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at the Scott ranch&mdash;we&#8217;re coming round
&#8216;the horn&#8217; to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the Supervisor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He headed across yesterday. Say, Cliff was
mad as a hornet when he started. I&#8217;d like to
know what happened&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane hung up the receiver. The
old woman&#8217;s nasty chuckle was intolerable; but
in silencing the &#8217;phone Mrs. McFarlane was perfectly
aware that she was not silencing the gossip;
on the contrary, she was certain that the
Beldens would leave a trail of poisonous comment
from the Ptarmigan to Bear Tooth. It was all
sweet material for them.</p>
<p>Berrie wanted to know who was speaking,
and Mrs. McFarlane replied: &#8220;Mrs. Belden
wanted to know if you got through all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said something else, something to heat
you up,&#8221; persisted the girl, who perceived her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
mother&#8217;s agitation. &#8220;What did she say&mdash;something
about me&mdash;and Cliff?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother did not answer, for Wayland entered
the room at the moment; but Berrie knew
that traducers were already busy with her
affairs. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care anything about old lady
Belden,&#8221; she said, later; &#8220;but I hate to have
that Moore girl telling lies about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Wayland, the nights in the camp by the
lake, and, indeed, all the experiences of his trip
in the high places were becoming each moment
more remote, more unreal. Camp life at timber-line
did not seem to him subject to ordinary
conventional laws of human conduct, and the
fact that he and Berrie had shared the same tent
under the stress of cold and snow, now seemed
so far away as to be only a complication in a
splendid mountain drama. Surely no blame
could attach to the frank and generous girl, even
though the jealous assault of Cliff Belden should
throw the valley into a fever of chatter. &#8220;Furthermore,
I don&#8217;t believe he will be in haste to
speak of his share in the play,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It
was too nearly criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was almost noon of the fourth day when the
Supervisor called up to say that he was at the
office, and would reach the ranch at six o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would come home at once,&#8221; his
wife argued; and something in her voice convinced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
him that he was more needed at home,
than in the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, mother. Hold the fort an hour
and I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane met him at the hitching-bar,
and it required but a glance for him to read in
her face a troubled state of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a disastrous trip for Berrie,&#8221;
she said, after one of the hands had relieved the
Supervisor of his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was a bit impatient. &#8220;Mrs. Belden is filling
the valley with the story of Berrie&#8217;s stay in
camp with Mr. Norcross.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face showed a graver line. &#8220;It couldn&#8217;t
be helped. The horses had to be followed, and
that youngster couldn&#8217;t do it&mdash;and, besides, I
expected to get back that night. Nobody but
an old snoop like Seth Belden would think evil of
our girl. And, besides, Norcross is a man to be
trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he is, but the Beldens are ready to
think evil of any one connected with us. And
Cliff&#8217;s assault on Wayland&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up quickly. &#8220;Assault? Did he
make trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he overtook them on the trail, and would
have killed Norcross if Berrie hadn&#8217;t interfered.
He was crazy with jealousy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nash didn&#8217;t say anything about any assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know it. Berrie told him that Norcross
fell from his horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane was deeply stirred. &#8220;I saw Cliff
leave camp, but I didn&#8217;t think anything of it.
Why should he jump Norcross?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Mrs. Belden filled him with distrust
of Berrie. He was already jealous, and
when he came up with them and found them
lunching together, he lost his head and rushed
at Wayland like a wild beast. Of course he
couldn&#8217;t stand against a big man like Cliff, and
his head struck on a stone; and if Berrie hadn&#8217;t
throttled the brute he would have murdered
the poor boy right there before her eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! I never suspected a word of
this. I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supervisor was now very grave. These
domestic matters at once threw his work as
forester into the region of vague and unimportant
abstractions. He began to understand the
danger into which Berea had fallen, and step
by step he took up the trails which had brought
them all to this pass.</p>
<p>He fixed another penetrating look upon her
face, and his voice was vibrant with anxiety as
he said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything&mdash;wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothing wrong; but she&#8217;s profoundly in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
love with him. I never have seen her so wrapped
up in any one. She thinks of nothing else. It
scares me to see it, for I&#8217;ve studied him closely
and I can&#8217;t believe he feels the same toward her.
His world is so different from ours. I don&#8217;t
know what to do or say. I fear she is in for a
period of great unhappiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was at the beginning of tears, and he
sought to comfort her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, honey,
she&#8217;s got too much horse sense to do anything
foolish. She&#8217;s grown up. I suppose it&#8217;s his
being so different from the other boys that catches
her. We&#8217;ve always been good chums&mdash;let me
talk with her. She mustn&#8217;t make a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The return of the crew from the corral cut
short this conference, and when McFarlane went
in Berrie greeted him with such frank and joyous
expression that all his fears vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you come over the high trail?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I came your way. I didn&#8217;t want to
take any chances on getting mired. It&#8217;s still
raining up there,&#8221; he answered, then turned to
Wayland: &#8220;Here&#8217;s your mail, Norcross, a whole
hatful of it&mdash;and one telegram in the bunch.
Hope it isn&#8217;t serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland took the bundle of letters and retired
to his room, glad to escape the persistent stare
of the cow-hands. The despatch was from his
father, and was curt and specific as a command:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
&#8220;Shall be in Denver on the 23d, meet me at the
Palmer House. Am on my way to California.
Come prepared to join me on the trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the letters unopened in his lap he sat
in silent thought, profoundly troubled by the
instant decision which this message demanded of
him. At first glance nothing was simpler than
to pack up and go. He was only a tourist in the
valley with no intention of staying; but there
was Berea! To go meant a violent end of their
pleasant romance. To think of flight saddened
him, and yet his better judgment was clearly on
the side of going. &#8220;Much as I like her, much as
I admire her, I cannot marry her. The simplest
way is to frankly tell her so and go. It seems
cowardly, but in the end she will be happier.&#8221;</p>
<p>His letters carried him back into his own world.
One was from Will Halliday, who was going with
Professor Holsman on an exploring trip up the
Nile. &#8220;You must join us. Holsman has promised
to take you on.&#8221; Another classmate wrote
to know if he did not want to go into a land deal
on the Gulf of Mexico. A girl asked: &#8220;Are you
to be in New York this winter? I am. I&#8217;ve
decided to go into this Suffrage Movement.&#8221;
And so, one by one, the threads which bound him
to Eastern city life re-spun their filaments.
After all, this Colorado outing, even though it
should last two years, would only be a vacation&mdash;his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
real life was in the cities of the East. Charming
as Berea was, potent as she seemed, she was
after all a fixed part of the mountain land, and
not to be taken from it. At the moment marriage
with her appeared absurd.</p>
<p>A knock at his door and the Supervisor&#8217;s voice
gave him a keen shock. &#8220;Come in,&#8221; he called,
springing to his feet with a thrill of dread, of
alarm.</p>
<p>McFarlane entered slowly and shut the door
behind him. His manner was serious, and his
voice gravely gentle as he said: &#8220;I hope that
telegram does not call you away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is from my father, asking me to meet him
in Denver,&#8221; answered Norcross, with faltering
breath. &#8220;He&#8217;s on his way to California. Won&#8217;t
you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man took a seat with quiet dignity.
&#8220;Seems like a mighty fine chance, don&#8217;t it?
I&#8217;ve always wanted to see the Coast. When do
you plan for to pull out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland was not deceived by the Supervisor&#8217;s
casual tone; there was something ominously calm
in his manner, something which expressed an
almost dangerous interest in the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t decided to go at all. I&#8217;m still
dazed by the suddenness of it. I didn&#8217;t know my
father was planning this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Well, before you decide to go I&#8217;d like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
to have a little talk with you. My daughter has
told me part of what happened to you on the
trail. I want to know <i>all</i> of it. You&#8217;re young,
but you&#8217;ve been out in the world, and you know
what people can say about you and my girl.&#8221; His
voice became level and menacing, as he added:
&#8220;And I don&#8217;t intend to have her put in wrong
on account of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross was quick to reply. &#8220;Nobody will
dare accuse her of wrongdoing. She&#8217;s a noble
girl. No one will dare to criticize her for what
she could not prevent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know the Beldens. My girl&#8217;s
character will be on trial in every house in the
county to-morrow. The Belden side of it will
appear in the city papers. Sympathy will be
with Clifford. Berrie will be made an issue by
my enemies. They&#8217;ll get me through her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Norcross, in sudden
realization of the gravity of the case. &#8220;What
beasts they are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moore&#8217;s gang will seize upon it and work it
hard,&#8221; McFarlane went on, with calm insistence.
&#8220;They want to bring the district forester down
on me. This is a fine chance to badger me.
They will make a great deal of my putting you
on the roll. Our little camping trip is likely to
prove a serious matter to us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you don&#8217;t consider me at fault?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>Worried as he was, the father was just. &#8220;No,
you&#8217;re not to blame&mdash;no one is to blame. It all
dates back to the horses quitting camp; but
you&#8217;ve got to stand pat now&mdash;for Berrie&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can I do? I&#8217;m at your service.
What rôle shall I play? Tell me what to do, and
I will do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane was staggered, but he answered:
&#8220;You can at least stay on the ground and help
fight. This is no time to stampede.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ll stay, and I&#8217;ll make any
statement you see fit. I&#8217;ll do anything that will
protect Berrie.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane again looked him squarely in the
eyes. &#8220;Is there a&mdash;an agreement between you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing formal&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean I admire
her, and I told her&mdash;&#8221; He stopped, feeling himself
on the verge of the irrevocable. &#8220;She&#8217;s a
splendid girl,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I like her exceedingly,
but I&#8217;ve known her only a few weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane interrupted. &#8220;Girls are flighty critters,&#8221;
he said, sadly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;s
taken to you so terrible strong; but she has. She
don&#8217;t seem to care what people say so long as they
do not blame you; but if you should pull out
you might just as well cut her heart to pieces&mdash;&#8221;
His voice broke, and it was a long time before
he could finish. &#8220;You&#8217;re not at fault, I know
that, but if you <i>can</i> stay on a little while and make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
it an ounce or two easier for her and for her
mother, I wish you&#8217;d do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland extended his hand impulsively. &#8220;Of
course I&#8217;ll stay. I never really thought of leaving.&#8221;
In the grip of McFarlane&#8217;s hand was
something warm and tender.</p>
<p>He rose. &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly obliged,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
we mustn&#8217;t let her suspect for a minute that
we&#8217;ve been discussing her. She hates being
pitied or helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She shall not experience a moment&#8217;s uneasiness
that I can prevent,&#8221; replied the youth; and
at the moment he meant it.</p>
<p>Berrie could not be entirely deceived. She
read in her father&#8217;s face a subtle change of line
which she related to something Wayland had
said. &#8220;Did he tell you what was in the telegram?
Has he got to go away?&#8221; she asked,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he said it was from his father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does his father want of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on his way to California and wants
Wayland to go with him; but Wayland says he&#8217;s
not going.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pang shot through Berrie&#8217;s heart. &#8220;He
mustn&#8217;t go&mdash;he isn&#8217;t able to go,&#8221; she exclaimed,
and her pain, her fear, came out in her sharpened,
constricted tone. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let him go&mdash;till
he&#8217;s well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane gently interposed. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
have to go, honey, if his father needs him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let his father come here.&#8221; She rose, and,
going to his door, decisively knocked. &#8220;May I
come in?&#8221; she demanded, rather than asked, before
her mother could protest. &#8220;I must see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland opened the door, and she entered,
leaving her parents facing each other in mute
helplessness.</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane turned toward her husband
with a face of despair. &#8220;She&#8217;s ours no longer,
Joe. Our time of bereavement has come.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her in his arms. &#8220;There, there,
mother. Don&#8217;t cry. It can&#8217;t be helped. You
cut loose from your parents and came to me in
just the same way. Our daughter&#8217;s a grown
woman, and must have her own life. All we can
do is to defend her against the coyotes who are
busy with her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what of <i>him</i>, Joe; he don&#8217;t care for her
as she does for him&mdash;can&#8217;t you see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do the right thing, mother; he told me
he would. He knows how much depends on
his staying here now, and he intends to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the end, Joe, after this scandal is
lived down, can he&mdash;will he&mdash;marry her? And
if he marries her can they live together and be
happy? His way of life is so different. He
can&#8217;t content himself here, and she can&#8217;t fit in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
where he belongs. It all seems hopeless to me.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be better for her to suffer for a little
while now than to make a mistake that may
last a lifetime?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe it would, mother, but the decision
is not ours. She&#8217;s too strong for us to control.
She&#8217;s of age, and if she comes to a full understanding
of the situation, she can decide the
question a whole lot better than either of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;In some ways
she&#8217;s bigger and stronger than both of us. Sometimes
I wish she were not so self-reliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the way life is, sometimes, and
I reckon there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; left for you an&#8217; me but
to draw closer together and try to fill up the
empty place she&#8217;s going to leave between us.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>THE SUMMONS</h3>
</div>

<p>When Wayland caught the startled look
on Berrie&#8217;s face he knew that she had
learned from her father the contents of his telegram,
and that she would require an explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going away?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. At least, I must go down to Denver to
see my father. I shall be gone only over night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you tell him about our trip?&#8221; she
pursued, with unflinching directness. &#8220;And
about&mdash;me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her a chair, and took a seat himself
before replying. &#8220;Yes, I shall tell him all about
it, and about you and your father and mother.
He shall know how kind you&#8217;ve all been to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this bravely, and at the moment he
meant it; but as his father&#8217;s big, impassive face
and cold, keen eyes came back to him his courage
sank, and in spite of his firm resolution some
part of his secret anxiety communicated itself
to the girl, who asked many questions, with intent
to find out more particularly what kind of
man the elder Norcross was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>Wayland&#8217;s replies did not entirely reassure
her. He admitted that his father was harsh
and domineering in character, and that he was
ambitious to have his son take up and carry forward
his work. &#8220;He was willing enough to have
me go to college till he found I was specializing
on wrong lines. Then I had to fight in order
to keep my place. He&#8217;s glad I&#8217;m out here, for
he thinks I&#8217;m regaining my strength. But just
as soon as I&#8217;m well enough he expects me to go
to Chicago and take charge of the Western office.
Of course, I don&#8217;t want to do that. I&#8217;d rather
work out some problem in chemistry that interests
me; but I may have to give in, for a time
at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will your mother and sisters be with your
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed! You couldn&#8217;t get any one of
them west of the Hudson River with a log-chain.
My sisters were both born in Michigan, but they
want to forget it&mdash;they pretend they have forgotten
it. They both have New-Yorkitis.
Nothing but the Plaza will do them now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they think we&#8217;re all &#8216;Injuns&#8217; out
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, not so bad as that; but they wouldn&#8217;t
comprehend anything about you except your
muscle. That would catch &#8217;em. They&#8217;d worship
your splendid health, just as I do. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
pitiful the way they both try to put on weight.
They&#8217;re always testing some new food, some new
tonic&mdash;they&#8217;ll do anything except exercise regularly
and go to bed at ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>All that he said of his family deepened her
dismay. Their interests were so alien to her
own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to have you go even for a day,&#8221;
she admitted, with simple honesty, which moved
him deeply. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I should do
if you went away. I think of nothing but you
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was pitiful, and he put his arm about
her neck as if she were a child. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t
do that. You must go on with your life just
as if I&#8217;d never been. Think of your father&#8217;s
job&mdash;of the forest and the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ve lost interest in the service.
I never want to go into the high country
again, and I don&#8217;t want you to go, either. It&#8217;s
too savage and cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is only a mood,&#8221; he said, confidently.
&#8220;It is splendid up there. I shall certainly go
back some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not divine, and she could not tell
him, how poignantly she had sensed the menace
of the cold and darkness during his illness. For
the first time in her life she had realized to the
full the unrelenting enmity of the clouds, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
wind, the night; and during that interminable
ride toward home, when she saw him bending
lower and lower over his saddle-bow, her allegiance
to the trail, her devotion to the stirrup was
broken. His weariness and pain had changed
the universe for her. Never again would she
look upon the range with the eyes of the care-free
girl. The other, the civilized, the domestic,
side of her was now dominant. A new desire,
a bigger aspiration, had taken possession of her.</p>
<p>Little by little he realized this change in her,
and was touched with the wonder of it. He had
never had any great self-love either as man or
scholar, and the thought of this fine, self-sufficient
womanly soul centering all its interests
on him was humbling. Each moment his responsibility
deepened, and he heard her voice
but dimly as she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we are not rich; but we are not
poor, and my mother&#8217;s family is one of the oldest
in Kentucky.&#8221; She uttered this with a
touch of her mother&#8217;s quiet dignity. &#8220;Your
father need not despise us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as my father is concerned, family don&#8217;t
count, and neither does money. But he confidently
expects me to take up his business in
Chicago, and I suppose it is my duty to do so.
If he finds me looking fit he may order me into
the ranks at once.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go there&mdash;I&#8217;ll do anything you want me
to do,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;You can tell your father
that I&#8217;ll help you in the office. I can learn.
I&#8217;m ready to use a typewriter&mdash;anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent in the face of her naïve expression
of self-sacrificing love, and after a moment
she added, hesitatingly: &#8220;I wish I could
meet your father. Perhaps he&#8217;d come up here
if you asked him to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>He seized upon the suggestion. &#8220;By George!
I believe he would. I don&#8217;t want to go to town.
I just believe I&#8217;ll wire him that I&#8217;m laid up here
and can&#8217;t come.&#8221; Then a shade of new trouble
came over his face. How would the stern,
methodical old business man regard this slovenly
ranch and its primitive ways? She felt the question
in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid to have him come,&#8221; she said,
with the same disconcerting penetration which
had marked every moment of her interview
thus far. &#8220;You&#8217;re afraid he wouldn&#8217;t like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>With almost equal frankness he replied: &#8220;No.
I think he&#8217;d like <i>you</i>, but this town and the
people up here would gall him. Order is a religion
with him. Then he&#8217;s got a vicious slant
against all this conservation business&mdash;calls it
tommy-rot. He and your father might lock
horns first crack out of the box. But I&#8217;ll risk it.
I&#8217;ll wire him at once.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>A knock at the door interrupted him, and Mrs.
McFarlane&#8217;s voice, filled with new excitement,
called out: &#8220;Berrie, the District office is on the
wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie opened the door and confronted her
mother, who said: &#8220;Mr. Evingham &#8217;phones that
the afternoon papers contain an account of a
fight at Coal City between Settle and one of
Alec Belden&#8217;s men, and that the District
Forester is coming down to investigate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him come,&#8221; answered Berrie, defiantly.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t do us any harm. What was the
row about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear much of it. Your father was
at the &#8217;phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane, with the receiver to his ear, was
saying: &#8220;Don&#8217;t know a thing about it, Mr.
Evingham. Settle was at the station when I
left. I didn&#8217;t know he was going down to Coal
City. No, that&#8217;s a mistake. My daughter was
never engaged to Alec Belden. Alec Belden
is the older of the brothers, and is married. I
can&#8217;t go into that just now. If you come down
I&#8217;ll explain fully.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and slowly turned
toward his wife and daughter. &#8220;This sure is
our day of trouble,&#8221; he said, with dejected
countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it all about?&#8221; asked Berrie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it seems that after I left yesterday
Settle rode down the valley with Belden&#8217;s outfit,
and they all got to drinking, ending in a row,
and Tony beat one of Belden&#8217;s men almost to
death. The sheriff has gone over to get Tony,
and the Beldens declare they&#8217;re going to railroad
him. That means we&#8217;ll all be brought into it.
Belden has seized the moment to prefer charges
against me for keeping Settle in the service and
for putting a non-resident on the roll as guard.
The whelp will dig up everything he can to queer
me with the office. All that kept him from doing
it before was Cliff&#8217;s interest in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t make any of his charges stick,&#8221;
declared Berrie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he can&#8217;t. He knows that. But he
can bring us all into court. You and Mr. Norcross
will both be called as witnesses, for it seems
that Tony was defending your name. The
papers call it &#8216;a fight for a girl.&#8217; Oh, it&#8217;s a sweet
mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Berrie betrayed alarm.
&#8220;What shall we do? I can&#8217;t go on the stand!
They can&#8217;t make me do that, can they?&#8221; She
turned to Wayland. &#8220;Now you <i>must</i> go away.
It is a shame to have you mixed up in such a
trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not run away and leave you and the
Supervisor to bear all the burden of this fight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>He anticipated in imagination&mdash;as they all
did&mdash;some of the consequences of this trial.
The entire story of the camping trip would be
dragged in, distorted into a scandal, and flashed
over the country as a disgraceful episode. The
country would ring with laughter and coarse
jest. Berrie&#8217;s testimony would be a feast for
court-room loafers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing to do,&#8221; said McFarlane,
after a few moments of thought. &#8220;You
and Berrie and Mrs. McFarlane must get out of
here before you are subpoenaed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave you to fight it out alone?&#8221; exclaimed
his wife. &#8220;I shall do nothing of the
kind. Berrie and Mr. Norcross can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do,&#8221; retorted McFarlane, quickly.
&#8220;That won&#8217;t do at all. You must go with
them. I can take care of myself. I will not
have you dragged into this muck-hole. We&#8217;ve
got to think quick and act quick. There won&#8217;t
be any delay about their side of the game. I
don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll do anything to-day; but
you&#8217;ve got to fade out of the valley. You all
get ready and I&#8217;ll have one of the boys hook up
the surrey as if for a little drive, and you can
pull out over the old stage-road to Flume and
catch the narrow-gage morning train for Denver.
You&#8217;ve been wanting for some time to go
down the line. Now here&#8217;s a good time to start.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>Berrie now argued against running away.
Her blood was up. She joined her mother.
&#8220;We won&#8217;t leave you to inherit all this trouble.
Who will look after the ranch? Who will keep
house for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlane remained firm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll manage.
Don&#8217;t worry about me. Just get out of reach.
The more I consider this thing, the more worrisome
it gets. Suppose Cliff should come back
to testify?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t. If he does I&#8217;ll have him arrested
for trying to kill Wayland,&#8221; retorted Berrie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And make the whole thing worse! No.
You are all going to cross the range. You can
start out as if for a little turn round the valley,
and just naturally keep going. It can&#8217;t do any
harm, and it may save a nasty time in court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think we were a lot of criminals,&#8221;
remarked Wayland.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way you&#8217;ll be treated,&#8221; retorted
McFarlane. &#8220;Belden has retained old Whitby,
the foulest old brute in the business, and he&#8217;ll
bring you all into it if he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But running away from it will not prevent
talk,&#8221; argued his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not entirely; but talk and testimony are two
different things. Suppose they call daughter to
the stand? Do you want her cross-examined as
to what basis there was for this gossip? They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
know something of Cliff&#8217;s being let out, and that
will inflame them. He may be at the mill this
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Norcross, sadly.
&#8220;Our delightful excursion into the forest has led
us into a predicament from which there is only
one way of escape, and that is flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back of all this talk, this argument, there remained
still unanswered the most vital, most important
question: &#8220;Shall I speak of marriage
at this time? Would it be a source of comfort
to them as well as a joy to her?&#8221; At the moment
he was ready to speak, for he felt himself to be
the direct cause of all their embarrassment.
But closer thought made it clear that a hasty
ceremony would only be considered a cloak to
cover something illicit. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it to the
future,&#8221; he decided.</p>
<p>McFarlane was again called to the telephone.
Landon, with characteristic brevity, conveyed to
him the fact that Mrs. Belden was at home and
busily &#8217;phoning scandalous stories about the
country. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t stop her she&#8217;s going to
poison every ear in the valley,&#8221; ended the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d all know my daughter
well enough not to believe anything Mrs. Belden
says,&#8221; responded McFarlane, bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the boys are ready to do what Tony did.
But nobody can stop this old fool&#8217;s mouth but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
you. Cliff has disappeared, and that adds to
the excitement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank the boys for me,&#8221; said McFarlane,
&#8220;and tell them not to fight. Tell &#8217;em to keep
cool. It will all be cleared up soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>As McFarlane went out to order the horses
hooked up, Wayland followed him as far as the
bars. &#8220;I&#8217;m conscience-smitten over this thing,
Supervisor, for I am aware that I am the cause
of all your trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that worry you,&#8221; responded the
older man. But he spoke with effort. &#8220;It can&#8217;t
be helped. It was all unavoidable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most appalling thing to me is the fact
that not even your daughter&#8217;s popularity can
neutralize the gossip of a woman like Mrs. Belden.
My being an outsider counts against Berrie,
and I&#8217;m ready to do anything&mdash;anything,&#8221;
he repeated, earnestly. &#8220;I love your daughter,
Mr. McFarlane, and I&#8217;m ready to marry her at
once if you think best. She&#8217;s a noble girl, and
I cannot bear to be the cause of her calumniation.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was mist in the Supervisor&#8217;s eyes as
he turned them on the young man. &#8220;I&#8217;m right
glad to hear you say that, my boy.&#8221; He reached
out his hand, and Wayland took it. &#8220;I knew
you&#8217;d say the word when the time came. I
didn&#8217;t know how strongly she felt toward you till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
to-day. I knew she liked you, of course, for she
said so, but I didn&#8217;t know that she had plum set
her heart on you. I didn&#8217;t expect her to marry
a city man; but&mdash;I like you and&mdash;well, she&#8217;s the
doctor! What suits her suits me. Don&#8217;t you
be afraid of her not meeting all comers.&#8221; He
went on after a pause, &#8220;She&#8217;s never seen much
of city life, but she&#8217;ll hold her own anywhere,
you can gamble on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has wonderful adaptability, I know,&#8221;
answered Wayland, slowly. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t like
to take her away from here&mdash;from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t come she would have married
Cliff&mdash;and what kind of a life would she have
led with him?&#8221; demanded McFarlane. &#8220;I knew
Cliff was rough, but I couldn&#8217;t convince her that
he was cheap. I live only for her happiness, my
boy, and, though I know you will take her away
from me, I believe you can make her happy, and
so&mdash;I give her over to you. As to time and
place, arrange that&mdash;with&mdash;her mother.&#8221; He
turned and walked away, unable to utter another
word.</p>
<p>Wayland&#8217;s throat was aching also, and he went
back into the house with a sense of responsibility
which exalted him into sturdier manhood.</p>
<p>Berea met him in a pretty gown, a dress he
had never seen her wear, a costume which transformed
her into something entirely feminine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>She seemed to have put away the self-reliant
manner of the trail, and in its stead presented
the lambent gaze, the tremulous lips of the bride.
As he looked at her thus transfigured his heart
cast out its hesitancy and he entered upon his
new adventure without further question or
regret.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>A MATTER OF MILLINERY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was three o&#8217;clock of a fine, clear, golden
afternoon as they said good-by to McFarlane
and started eastward, as if for a little drive.
Berrie held the reins in spite of Wayland&#8217;s protestations.
&#8220;These bronchos are only about half
busted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They need watching. I
know them better than you do.&#8221; Therefore he
submitted, well knowing that she was entirely
competent and fully informed.</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane, while looking back at her
husband, sadly exclaimed: &#8220;I feel like a coward
running away like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, mother,&#8221; commanded her daughter,
cheerily. &#8220;Just imagine we&#8217;re off for a short
vacation. I&#8217;m for going clear through to Chicago.
So long as we <i>must</i> go, let&#8217;s go whooping. Father&#8217;s
better off without us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was gay, her eyes shining, and Wayland
saw her as she had been that first day in
the coach&mdash;the care-free, laughing girl. The
trouble they were fleeing from was less real to
her than the happiness toward which she rode.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>Her hand on the reins, her foot on the brake,
brought back her confidence; but Wayland did
not feel so sure of his part in the adventure.
She seemed so unalterably a part of this life,
so fitted to this landscape, that the thought of
transplanting her to the East brought uneasiness
and question. Could such a creature of the
open air be content with the walls of a city?</p>
<p>For several miles the road ran over the level
floor of the valley, and she urged the team to full
speed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to meet anybody if I
can help it. Once we reach the old stage route
the chances of being scouted are few. Nobody
uses that road since the broad-gauge reached
Cragg&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane could not rid herself of the
resentment with which she suffered this enforced
departure; but she had small opportunity to
protest, for the wagon bumped and clattered
over the stony stretches with a motion which
confused as well as silenced her. It was all so
humiliating, so unlike the position which she had
imagined herself to have attained in the eyes of
her neighbors. Furthermore, she was going
away without a trunk, with only one small bag
for herself and Berrie&mdash;running away like a
criminal from an intangible foe. However, she
was somewhat comforted by the gaiety of the
young people before her. They were indeed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
jocund as jaybirds. With the resiliency of youth
they had accepted the situation, and were making
the best of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes somebody,&#8221; called Berrie, pulling
her ponies to a walk. &#8220;Throw a blanket over
that valise.&#8221; She was chuckling as if it were all
a good joke. &#8220;It&#8217;s old Jake Proudfoot. I can
smell him. Now hang on. I&#8217;m going to pass
him on the jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland, who was riding with his hat in his
hand because he could not make it cover his
bump, held it up as if to keep the wind from his
face, and so defeated the round-eyed, owl-like
stare of the inquisitive rancher, who brought his
team to a full stop in order to peer after them,
muttering in a stupor of resentment and surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll worry himself sick over us,&#8221; predicted
Berrie. &#8220;He&#8217;ll wonder where we&#8217;re going and
what was under that blanket till the end of summer.
He is as curious as a fool hen.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes more and they were at the fork
in the way, and, leaving the trail to Cragg&#8217;s, the
girl pulled into the grass-grown, less-traveled
trail to the south, which entered the timber at
this point and began to climb with steady grade.
Letting the reins fall slack, she turned to her
mother with reassuring words. &#8220;There! Now
we&#8217;re safe. We won&#8217;t meet anybody on this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
road except possibly a mover&#8217;s outfit. We&#8217;re
in the forest again,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>For two hours they crawled slowly upward,
with a roaring stream on one side and the pine-covered
slopes on the other. Jays and camp-birds
called from the trees. Water-robins fluttered
from rock to rock in the foaming flood.
Squirrels and minute chipmunks raced across
the fallen tree-trunks or clattered from great
boulders, and in the peace and order and beauty
of the forest they all recovered a serener outlook
on the noisome tumult they were leaving behind
them. Invisible as well as inaudible, the serpent
of slander lost its terror.</p>
<p>Once, as they paused to rest the horses, Wayland
said: &#8220;It is hard to realize that down in
that ethereal valley people like old Jake and Mrs.
Belden have their dwelling-place.&#8221;</p>
<p>This moved Mrs. McFarlane to admit that it
might all turn out a blessing in disguise. &#8220;Mr.
McFarlane may resign and move to Denver, as
I&#8217;ve long wanted him to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he would,&#8221; exclaimed Berrie, fervently.
&#8220;It&#8217;s time you had a rest. Daddy will
hate to quit under fire, but he&#8217;d better do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peak by peak the Bear Tooth Range rose behind
them, while before them the smooth, grassy
slopes of the pass told that they were nearing
timber-line. The air was chill, the sun was hidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
by old Solidor, and the stream had diminished
to a silent rill winding among sear grass
and yellowed willows. The valley behind them
was vague with mist. The southern boundary
of the forest was in sight.</p>
<p>At last the topmost looming crags of the Continental
Divide cut the sky-line, and then in the
smooth hollow between two rounded grassy summits
Berrie halted, and they all silently contemplated
the two worlds. To the west and
north lay an endless spread of mountains, wave
on wave, snow-lined, savage, sullen in the dying
light; while to the east and southeast the foot-hills
faded into the plain, whose dim cities, insubstantial
as flecks in a veil of violet mist,
were hardly distinguishable without the aid of
glasses.</p>
<p>To the girl there was something splendid,
something heroical in that majestic, menacing
landscape to the west. In one of its folds she
had begun her life. In another she had grown
to womanhood and self-confident power. The
rough men, the coarse, ungainly women of that
land seemed less hateful now that she was leaving
them, perhaps forever, and a confused memory
of the many splendid dawns and purple sunsets
she had loved filled her thought.</p>
<p>Wayland, divining some part of what was moving
in her mind, cheerily remarked, &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
a splendid place for a summer vacation, but a
stern place in winter-time, and for a lifelong residence
it is not inspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane agreed with him in this estimate.
&#8220;It <i>is</i> terribly lonesome in there at times.
I&#8217;ve had enough of it. I&#8217;m ready for the comforts
of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie turned in her seat, and was about to
take up the reins when Wayland asserted himself.
&#8220;Wait a moment. Here&#8217;s where my dominion
begins. Here&#8217;s where you change seats
with me. I am the driver now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with questioning, smiling
glance. &#8220;Can you drive? It&#8217;s all the way
down-hill&mdash;and steep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t I&#8217;ll ask your aid. I&#8217;m old enough
to remember the family carriage. I&#8217;ve even
driven a four-in-hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She surrendered her seat doubtfully, and
smiled to see him take up the reins as if he were
starting a four-horse coach. He proved adequate
and careful, and she was proud of him as,
with foot on the brake and the bronchos well
in hand, he swung down the long looping road
to the railway. She was pleased, too, by his
care of the weary animals, easing them down
the steepest slopes and sending them along on
the comparatively level spots.</p>
<p>Their descent was rapid, but it was long after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
dark before they reached Flume, which lay up
the valley to the right. It was a poor little
decaying mining-town set against the hillside,
and had but one hotel, a sun-warped and sagging
pine building just above the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much like the Profile House,&#8221; said Wayland,
as he drew up to the porch. &#8220;But I see
no choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any,&#8221; Berrie assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I am in command
of this expedition. From this on I lead this outfit.
When it comes to hotels, railways, and the
like o&#8217; that, I&#8217;m head ranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane, tired, hungry, and a little
dismayed, accepted his control gladly; but Berrie
could not at once slip aside her responsibility.
&#8220;Tell the hostler&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word!&#8221; commanded Norcross; and the
girl with a smile submitted to his guidance, and
thereafter his efficiency, his self-possession, his
tact delighted her. He persuaded the sullen
landlady to get them supper. He secured the
best rooms in the house, and arranged for the
care of the team, and when they were all seated
around the dim, fly-specked oil-lamp at the end
of the crumby dining-room table he discovered
such a gay and confident mien that the women
looked at each other in surprise.</p>
<p>Berrie was correspondingly less masculine. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
drawing off her buckskin driving-gloves she had
put away the cowgirl, and was silent, a little
sad even, in the midst of her enjoyment of his
dictatorship. And when he said, &#8220;If my father
reaches Denver in time I want you to meet him,&#8221;
she looked the dismay she felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it&mdash;but I&#8217;m scared of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be. I&#8217;ll see him first and draw
his fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane interposed. &#8220;We must do a
little shopping first. We can&#8217;t meet your father
as we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I&#8217;ll go with you if you&#8217;ll let me.
I&#8217;m a great little shopper. I have infallible
taste, so my sisters say. If it&#8217;s a case of buying
new hats, for instance, I&#8217;m the final authority
with them.&#8221; This amused Berrie, but her
mother took it seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m anxious to have my daughter
make the best possible impression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. It is arranged. We get in, I
find, about noon. We&#8217;ll go straight to the biggest
shop in town. If we work with speed we&#8217;ll
be able to lunch with my father. He&#8217;ll be at the
Palmer House at one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie said nothing, either in acceptance or
rejection of his plan. Her mind was concerned
with new conceptions, new relationships, and
when in the hall he took her face between his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
hands and said, &#8220;Cheer up! All is not lost,&#8221; she
put her arms about his neck and laid her cheek
against his breast to hide her tears. &#8220;Oh, Wayland!
I&#8217;m such an idiot in the city. I&#8217;m afraid
your father will despise me.&#8221;</p>
<p>What he said was not very cogent, and not in
the least literary, but it was reassuring and lover-like,
and when he turned her over to her mother
she was composed, though unwontedly grave.</p>
<p>She woke to a new life next morning&mdash;a life
of compliance, of following, of dependence upon
the judgment of another. She stood in silence
while her lover paid the bills, bought the tickets,
and telegraphed their coming to his father. She
acquiesced when he prevented her mother from
telephoning to the ranch. She complied when
he countermanded her order to have the team
sent back at once. His judgment ruled, and she
enjoyed her sudden freedom from responsibility.
It was novel, and it was very sweet to think that
she was being cared for as she had cared for and
shielded him in the world of the trail.</p>
<p>In the little railway-coach, which held a score
of passengers, she found herself among some
Eastern travelers who had taken the trip up
the Valley of the Flume in the full belief that
they were piercing the heart of the Rocky Mountains!
It amused Wayland almost as much as
it amused Berrie when one man said to his wife:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve seen the Rockies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He really believes it!&#8221; exclaimed Norcross.</p>
<p>After an hour&#8217;s ride Wayland tactfully withdrew,
leaving mother and daughter to discuss
clothes undisturbed by his presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must look our best, honey,&#8221; said Mrs.
McFarlane. &#8220;We will go right to Mme. Crosby
at Battle&#8217;s, and she&#8217;ll fit us out. I wish we had
more time; but we haven&#8217;t, so we must do the
best we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Wayland to choose my hat and traveling-suit,&#8221;
replied Berrie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. But you&#8217;ve got to have a lot
of other things besides.&#8221; And they bent to the
joyous work of making out a list of goods to be
purchased as soon as they reached Chicago.</p>
<p>Wayland came back with a Denver paper in
his hand and a look of disgust on his face. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all in here&mdash;at least, the outlines of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie took the journal, and there read the
details of Settle&#8217;s assault upon the foreman.
&#8220;The fight arose from a remark concerning the
Forest Supervisor&#8217;s daughter. Ranger Settle resented
the gossip, and fell upon the other man,
beating him with the butt of his revolver.
Friends of the foreman claim that the ranger is
a drunken bully, and should have been discharged
long ago. The Supervisor for some mysterious
reason retains this man, although he is an incompetent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
It is also claimed that McFarlane put
a man on the roll without examination.&#8221; The
Supervisor was the protagonist of the play,
which was plainly political. The attack upon
him was bitter and unjust, and Mrs. McFarlane
again declared her intention of returning to help
him in his fight. However, Wayland again
proved to her that her presence would only embarrass
the Supervisor. &#8220;You would not aid
him in the slightest degree. Nash and Landon
are with him, and will refute all these charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>This newspaper story took the light out of
their day and the smile from Berrie&#8217;s lips, and
the women entered the city silent and distressed
in spite of the efforts of their young guide. The
nearer the girl came to the ordeal of facing the
elder Norcross, the more she feared the outcome;
but Wayland kept his air of easy confidence, and
drove them directly to the shopping center,
believing that under the influence of hats and
gloves they would regain their customary cheer.</p>
<p>In this he was largely justified. They had a
delightful hour trying on millinery and coats and
gloves. The forewoman, who knew Mrs. McFarlane,
gladly accepted her commission, and, while
suspecting the tender relationship between the
girl and the man, she was tactful enough to conceal
her suspicion. &#8220;The gentleman is right;
you carry simple things best,&#8221; she remarked to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Berrie, thus showing her own good judgment.
&#8220;Smartly tailored gray or blue suits are your
style.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silent, blushing, tousled by the hands of her
decorators, Berrie permitted hats to be perched
on her head and jackets buttoned and unbuttoned
about her shoulders till she felt like a worn
clothes-horse. Wayland beamed with delight,
but she was far less satisfied than he; and when
at last selection was made, she still had her
doubts, not of the clothes, but of her ability to
wear them. They seemed so alien to her, so
restrictive and enslaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an easy fitter,&#8221; said the saleswoman.
&#8220;But&#8221;&mdash;here she lowered her voice&mdash;&#8220;you need
a new corset. This old one is out of date. Nobody
is wearing hips now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Berrie meekly permitted herself to
be led away to a torture-room. Wayland waited
patiently, and when she reappeared all traces of
Bear Tooth Forest had vanished. In a neat
tailored suit and a very &#8220;chic&#8221; hat, with shoes,
gloves, and stockings to match, she was so transformed,
so charmingly girlish in her self-conscious
glory, that he was tempted to embrace
her in the presence of the saleswoman. But he
didn&#8217;t. He merely said: &#8220;I see the governor&#8217;s
finish! Let&#8217;s go to lunch. You are stunning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know myself,&#8221; responded Berrie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
&#8220;The only thing that feels natural is my hand.
They cinched me so tight I can&#8217;t eat a thing,
and my shoes hurt.&#8221; She laughed as she said
this, for her use of the vernacular was conscious.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a fraud. Your father will spot my brand
first shot. Look at my face&mdash;red as a saddle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that trouble you. This is the time
of year when tan is fashionable. Don&#8217;t you be
afraid of the governor. Just smile at him, give
him your grip, and he&#8217;ll melt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one to melt. I&#8217;m beginning now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how you feel, but you&#8217;ll get used to
the conventional boiler-plate and all the rest of
it. We all groan and growl when we come back
to it each autumn; but it&#8217;s a part of being civilized,
and we submit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his confident advice, Wayland
led the two silent and inwardly dismayed
women into the showy café of the hotel with
some degree of personal apprehension concerning
the approaching interview with his father.
Of course, he did not permit this to appear in
the slightest degree. On the contrary, he gaily
ordered a choice lunch, and did his best to keep
his companions from sinking into deeper depression.</p>
<p>It pleased him to observe the admiring glances
which were turned upon Berrie, whose hat became
her mightily, and, leaning over, he said in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
a low voice to Mrs. McFarlane: &#8220;Who is the
lovely young lady opposite? Won&#8217;t you introduce
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This rejoiced the mother almost as much as
it pleased the daughter, and she answered, &#8220;She
looks like one of the Radburns of Lexington,
but I think she&#8217;s from Louisville.&#8221;</p>
<p>This little play being over, he said, &#8220;Now,
while our order is coming I&#8217;ll run out to the
desk and see if the governor has come in or not.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>THE PRIVATE CAR</h3>
</div>

<p>After he went away Berrie turned to her
mother with a look in which humor and
awe were blent. &#8220;Am I dreaming, mother, or
am I actually sitting here in the city? My head
is dizzy with it all.&#8221; Then, without waiting for
an answer, she fervently added: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he fine!
I&#8217;m the tenderfoot now. I hope his father won&#8217;t
despise me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With justifiable pride in her child, the mother
replied: &#8220;He can&#8217;t help liking you, honey. You
look exactly like your grandmother at this
moment. Meet Mr. Norcross in her spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try; but I feel like a woodchuck out of
his hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane continued: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we
were forced out of the valley. You might have
been shut in there all your life as I have been
with your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t blame father, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not entirely. And yet he always was rather
easy-going, and you know how untidy the ranch
is. He&#8217;s always been kindness and sympathy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
itself; but his lack of order is a cross. Perhaps
now he will resign, rent the ranch, and move
over here. I should like to live in the city for
a while, and I&#8217;d like to travel a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be fine if you could! You could
live at this hotel if you wanted to. Yes, you&#8217;re
right. You need a rest from the ranch and
dish-washing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland returned with an increase of tension
in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here! I&#8217;ve sent word saying, &#8216;I am
lunching in the café with ladies.&#8217; I think he&#8217;ll
come round. But don&#8217;t be afraid of him. He&#8217;s
a good deal rougher on the outside than he is at
heart. Of course, he&#8217;s a bluff old business man,
and not at all pretty, and he&#8217;ll transfix you with
a kind of estimating glare as if you were a tree;
but he&#8217;s actually very easy to manage if you
know how to handle him. Now, I&#8217;m not going
to try to explain everything to him at the beginning.
I&#8217;m going to introduce him to you in
a casual kind of way and give him time to take
to you both. He forms his likes and dislikes
very quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he don&#8217;t like us?&#8221; inquired Berrie,
with troubled brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t help it.&#8221; His tone was so positive
that her eyes misted with happiness. &#8220;But here
comes our food. I hope you aren&#8217;t too nervous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
to eat. Here is where I shine as provider. This
is the kind of camp fare I can recommend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie&#8217;s healthy appetite rose above her apprehension,
and she ate with the keen enjoyment
of a child, and her mother said, &#8220;It surely is
a treat to get a chance at somebody else&#8217;s
cooking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you slander your home fare,&#8221; warned
Wayland. &#8220;It&#8217;s as good as this, only different.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat where he could watch the door, and
despite his jocund pose his eyes expressed growing
impatience and some anxiety. They were
all well into their dessert before he called out:
&#8220;Here he is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane could not see the new-comer
from where she sat, but Berrie rose in great
excitement as a heavy-set, full-faced man with
short, gray mustache and high, smooth brow
entered the room. He did not smile as he
greeted his son, and his penetrating glance questioned
even before he spoke. He seemed to silently
ask: &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s all this? How do you
happen to be here? Who are these women?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland said: &#8220;Mrs. McFarlane, this is my
father. Father, this is Miss Berea McFarlane,
of Bear Tooth Springs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The elder Norcross shook hands with Mrs.
McFarlane politely, coldly; but he betrayed
surprise as Berea took his fingers in her grip.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
At his son&#8217;s solicitation he accepted a seat opposite
Berea, but refused dessert.</p>
<p>Wayland explained: &#8220;Mrs. McFarlane and
her daughter quite saved my life over in the
valley. Their ranch is the best health resort
in Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your complexion indicates that,&#8221; his father
responded, dryly. &#8220;You look something the
way a man of your age ought to look. I needn&#8217;t
ask how you&#8217;re feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t, but you may. I&#8217;m feeling like
a new fiddle&mdash;barring a bruise at the back of my
head, which makes a &#8216;hard hat&#8217; a burden. I may
as well tell you first off that Mrs. McFarlane
is the wife of the Forest Supervisor at Bear
Tooth, and Miss Berea is the able assistant of
her father. We are all rank conservationists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross, Senior, examined Berrie precisely as
if his eyes were a couple of X-ray tubes, and as
she flushed under his slow scrutiny he said:
&#8220;I was not expecting to find the Forest Service
in such hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t mash his fingers, Berrie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled guiltily. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I did. I
hope I didn&#8217;t hurt you&mdash;sometimes I forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norcross, Senior, was waking up. &#8220;You have
a most extraordinary grip. What did it? Piano
practice?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>Wayland grinned. &#8220;Piano! No&mdash;the cinch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland explained. &#8220;Miss McFarlane was
brought up on a ranch. She can rope and tie
a steer, saddle her own horse, pack an outfit, and
all the rest of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Kind of cowgirl, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McFarlane, eager to put Berrie&#8217;s better
part forward, explained: &#8220;She&#8217;s our only child,
Mr. Norcross, and as such has been a constant
companion to her father. She&#8217;s not all cow-hand.
She&#8217;s been to school, and she can cook
and sew as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked from one to the other. &#8220;Neither
of you correspond exactly to my notions of a
forester&#8217;s wife and daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. McFarlane comes from an old Kentucky
family, father. Her grandfather helped to found
a college down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland&#8217;s anxious desire to create a favorable
impression of the women did not escape the
lumberman, but his face remained quite expressionless
as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;If the life of a cow-hand would give you the
vigor this young lady appears to possess, I&#8217;m
not sure but you&#8217;d better stick to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland and the two women exchanged
glances of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not tell him now?&#8221; they seemed to ask.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
But he said: &#8220;There&#8217;s a long story to tell before
we decide on my career. Let&#8217;s finish our lunch.
How is mother, and how are the girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once, in the midst of a lame pursuit of other
topics, the elder Norcross again fixed his eyes
on Berea, saying: &#8220;I wish my girls had your
weight and color.&#8221; He paused a moment, then
resumed with weary infliction: &#8220;Mrs. Norcross
has always been delicate, and all her children&mdash;even
her son&mdash;take after her. I&#8217;ve maintained
a private and very expensive hospital for nearly
thirty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>This regretful note in his father&#8217;s voice gave
Wayland confidence. His spirits rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s adjourn to the parlor and talk
things over at our ease.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all followed him, and after showing the
mother and daughter to their seats near a window
he drew his father into a corner, and in
rapid undertone related the story of his first
meeting with Berrie, of his trouble with young
Belden, of his camping trip, minutely describing
the encounter on the mountainside, and ended
by saying, with manly directness: &#8220;I would be
up there in the mountains in a box if Berrie had
not intervened. She&#8217;s a noble girl, father, and
is foolish enough to like me, and I&#8217;m going to
marry her and try to make her happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old lumberman, who had listened intently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
all through this impassioned story, displayed no
sign of surprise at its closing declaration; but
his eyes explored his son&#8217;s soul with calm abstraction.
&#8220;Send her over to me,&#8221; he said, at
last. &#8220;Marriage is a serious matter. I want to
talk with her&mdash;alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland went back to the women with an
air of victory. &#8220;He wants to see you, Berrie.
He&#8217;s mellowing. Don&#8217;t be afraid of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She might have resented the father&#8217;s lack of
gallantry; but she did not. On the contrary,
she rose and walked resolutely over to where he
sat, quite ready to defend herself. He did not
rise to meet her, but she did not count that
against him, for there was nothing essentially
rude in his manner. He was merely her elder,
and inert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said, not unkindly. &#8220;I want
to have <i>you</i> tell me about my son. He has been
telling me all about you. Now let&#8217;s have your
side of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a seat and faced him with eyes as
steady as his own. &#8220;Where shall I begin?&#8221; she
bluntly challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to marry you. Now, it seems to
me that seven weeks is very short acquaintance
for a decision like that. Are you sure you want
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I am.&#8221; Her answer was most decided.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>His voice was slightly cynical as he went on.
&#8220;But you were tolerably sure about that other
fellow&mdash;that rancher with the fancy name&mdash;weren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; She flushed at this, but waited
for him to go on. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it possible
that your fancy for Wayland is also temporary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; she bravely declared. &#8220;I never felt
toward any one the way I do toward Wayland.
He&#8217;s different. I shall <i>never</i> change toward
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tone, her expression of eyes stopped this
line of inquiry. He took up another. &#8220;Now,
my dear young lady, I am a business man as well
as a father, and the marriage of my son is a
weighty matter. He is my main dependence.
I am hoping to have him take up and carry on
my business. To be quite candid, I didn&#8217;t expect
him to select his wife from a Colorado ranch.
I considered him out of the danger-zone. I have
always understood that women were scarce in
the mountains. Now don&#8217;t misunderstand me.
I&#8217;m not one of those fools who are always trying
to marry their sons and daughters into the ranks
of the idle rich. I don&#8217;t care a hang about
social position, and I&#8217;ve got money enough for
my son and my son&#8217;s wife. But he&#8217;s all the boy
I have, and I don&#8217;t want him to make a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; she answered, simply, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
eyes suffused with tears. &#8220;If I thought he would
be sorry&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He interrupted again. &#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t tell
that now. Any marriage is a risk. I don&#8217;t say
he&#8217;s making a mistake in selecting you. You
may be just the woman he needs. Only I want
to be consulted. I want to know more about
you. He tells me you have taken an active
part in the management of the ranch and the
forest. Is that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always worked with my father&mdash;yes,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You like that kind of life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about any other kind.
Yes, I like it. But I&#8217;ve had enough of it. I&#8217;m
willing to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how about city life&mdash;housekeeping and
all that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as I am with Wayland I sha&#8216;n&#8217;t
mind what I do or where I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time you figure he&#8217;s going to
have a large income, I suppose? He&#8217;s told you
of his rich father, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Berrie&#8217;s tone was a shade resentful of his insinuation.
&#8220;He has never said much about his
family one way or another. He only said you
wanted him to go into business in Chicago, and
that he wanted to do something else. Of course,
I could see by his ways and the clothes he wore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
that he&#8217;d been brought up in what we&#8217;d call
luxury, but we never inquired into his affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t care?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not that, exactly. But money don&#8217;t
count for as much with us in the valley as it
does in the East. Wayland seemed so kind of
sick and lonesome, and I felt sorry for him the
first time I saw him. I felt like mothering him.
And then his way of talking, of looking at things
was so new and beautiful to me I couldn&#8217;t help
caring for him. I had never met any one like
him. I thought he was a &#8216;lunger&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A consumptive; that is, I did at first. And
it bothered me. It seemed terrible that any
one so fine should be condemned like that&mdash;and
so&mdash;I did all I could to help him, to make him
happy. I thought he hadn&#8217;t long to live.
Everything he said and did was wonderful to
me, like poetry and music. And then when he
began to grow stronger and I saw that he was
going to get well, and Cliff went on the rampage
and showed the yellow streak, and I gave him
back his ring&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know even then how
much Wayland meant to me. But on our trip
over the Range I understood. He meant everything
to me. He made Cliff seem like a savage,
and I wanted him to know it. I&#8217;m not ashamed
of loving him. I want to make him happy, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
if he wishes me to be his wife I&#8217;ll go anywhere
he says&mdash;only I think he should stay out here
till he gets entirely well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s eyes softened during her plea,
and at its close a slight smile moved the corners
of his mouth. &#8220;You&#8217;ve thought it all out, I see.
Your mind is clear and your conscience easy.
Well, I like your spirit. I guess he&#8217;s right. The
decision is up to you. But if he takes you and
stays in Colorado he can&#8217;t expect me to share
the profits of my business with him, can he?
He&#8217;ll have to make his own way.&#8221; He rose and
held out his hand. &#8220;However, I&#8217;m persuaded
he&#8217;s in good hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took his hand, not knowing just what to
reply. He examined her fingers with intent
gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know any woman could have such
a grip.&#8221; He thoughtfully took her biceps in his
left hand. &#8220;You are magnificent.&#8221; Then, in
ironical protest, he added: &#8220;Good God, no! I
can&#8217;t have you come into my family. You&#8217;d
make caricatures of my wife and daughters.
Are all the girls out in the valley like you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed. &#8220;No. Most of them pride
themselves on <i>not</i> being horsewomen. Mighty
few of &#8217;em ever ride a horse. I&#8217;m a kind of a
tomboy to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear that. It&#8217;s the same old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
story. I suppose they&#8217;d all like to live in the
city and wear low-necked gowns and high-heeled
shoes. No, I can&#8217;t consent to your marriage
with my son. I must save you from corruption.
Go back to the ranch. I can see
already signs of your deterioration. Except for
your color and that grip you already look like
upper Broadway. The next thing will be a slit
skirt and a diamond garter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed redly, conscious of her new corset,
her silk stockings, and her pinching shoes. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all on the outside,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Under this
toggery I&#8217;m the same old trailer. It don&#8217;t take
long to get rid of these things. I&#8217;m just playing
a part to-day&mdash;for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled and dropped her hand. &#8220;No, no.
You&#8217;ve said good-by to the cinch, I can see that.
You&#8217;re on the road to opera boxes and limousines.
What is your plan? What would you advise
Wayland to do if you knew I was hard against
his marrying you? Come, now, I can see you&#8217;re
a clear-sighted individual. What can he do
to earn a living? How will you live without
my aid? Have you figured on these
things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m going to ask my father to buy a
ranch near here, where mother can have more
of the comforts of life, and where we can all
live together till Wayland is able to stand city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
life again. Then, if you want him to go East,
I will go with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had moved slowly back toward the
others, and as Wayland came to meet them
Norcross said, with dry humor: &#8220;I admire your
lady of the cinch hand. She seems to be a person
of singular good nature and most uncommon
shrewd&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayland, interrupting, caught at his father&#8217;s
hand and wrung it frenziedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! Here!&#8221; A look of pain covered the
father&#8217;s face. &#8220;That&#8217;s the fist she put in the
press.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all laughed at his joke, and then he
gravely resumed. &#8220;I say I admire her, but it&#8217;s
a shame to ask such a girl to marry an invalid
like you. Furthermore, I won&#8217;t have her taken
East. She&#8217;d bleach out and lose that grip in a
year. I won&#8217;t have her contaminated by the
city.&#8221; He mused deeply while looking at his
son. &#8220;Would life on a wheat-ranch accessible
to this hotel by motor-car be endurable to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean with Berea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;ll go. Mind you, I don&#8217;t advise her
to do it!&#8221; he added, interrupting his son&#8217;s outcry.
&#8220;I think she&#8217;s taking all the chances.&#8221;
He turned to Mrs. McFarlane. &#8220;I&#8217;m old-fashioned
in my notions of marriage, Mrs.
McFarlane. I grew up when women were helpmates,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
such as, I judge, you&#8217;ve been. Of course,
it&#8217;s all guesswork to me at the moment; but I
have an impression that my son has fallen into
an unusual run of luck. As I understand it,
you&#8217;re all out for a pleasure trip. Now, my
private car is over in the yards, and I suggest
you all come along with me to California&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor, you&#8217;re a wonder!&#8221; exclaimed Wayland.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll give us time to get better acquainted,
and if we all like one another just as well when
we get back&mdash;well, we&#8217;ll buy the best farm in
the North Platte and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cinch we get that ranch,&#8221; interrupted
Wayland, with a triumphant glance at Berea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure of it!&#8221; replied the lumberman.
&#8220;A private car, like a yacht, is a terrible
test of friendship.&#8221; But his warning held no
terrors for the young lovers. They had entered
upon certainties.</p>
